</div>
<p class="drop-cap">A learned mathematician of the seventeenth century,
Ozanam by name, a member of the Academy
of Sciences and author of several distinguished
works, did not think it derogatory to his dignity
to write, under the title of “Mathematical and
Physical Recreations,” a book designed for the
amusement of youth, in which science lends itself
to every pastime, even jugglery and tricks of legerdemain.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Jeux d’esprit</i>” says Ozanam, “are for all seasons and all
ages; they instruct the young, they amuse the old, they are
welcomed by the rich, and are not above the reach of the poor.”</p>

<p>The object of the book now presented to the reader is also
to instruct while it amuses, but we have not thought proper to make
use, as Ozanam did, of any physical feats, so called <em>amusing</em>. Such
do not constitute experiments, and are but ingenious deceptions,
intended to disguise the true mode of operation, and we have not
desired to make use of or popularise such methods. We wish, on
the contrary, that every game we describe, every pastime or amusement
of which we give the exposition, should be rigorously based on
the scientific method, and looked upon as a genuine exercise in
physics, chemistry, mechanics, or natural science. It does not
appear to us desirable to teach deception, even in play.</p>

<p>Science in the open air, in the fields, in the sunshine, is our first
study; we point out how, in the country, it is possible, pleasantly
and unceasingly, to occupy one’s leisure in observing nature, in
capturing insects or aquatic animals, or in noting atmospheric
phenomena.</p>

<p>We next teach a complete course of physics without any apparatus,
and point out the methods for studying the different phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
of heat, light, optics, and electricity, by means of a simple water-bottle,
tumbler, stick of sealing-wax, and other ordinary objects, such
as everyone has at hand. A series of chemical experiments, performed
by means of some phials and inexpensive appliances, completes
that part of the book relating to the physical sciences.</p>

<p>Another kind of recreation, both intelligent and useful, consists
in collecting the ingenious inventions which are constantly being
supplied to our requirements by the applied sciences, and learning
how to use them. We have collected a number of mechanical
inventions and appliances, with which most ingenious and skilful
people will wish to supply themselves, from Edison’s electric pen,
or the chromograph, which will produce a large number of copies of
a letter, drawing, etc., to the more complicated, but not less valuable
contrivances, for making science useful in the house.</p>

<p>Having described some scientific toys for the young, we have
endeavoured to point out those interesting to persons of riper years,
and have grouped together curious systems of locomotion, and ingenious
mechanical appliances, such as small steam-boats, ice-boats,
swimming apparatus, etc., under proper heads.</p>

<p>In addition to the foregoing subjects, we have included some
of the experimental details of Chemical Science, with illustrations.
We have added a chapter upon Aërial Navigation and Ballooning,
with anecdotes of some of our celebrated aëronauts. We have also
enlarged upon Light, Sound, Heat, Physical Geography, Mineralogy,
Geology, Electrical Appliances, the Electric Light, and most of the
latest adaptations of electricity.</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that the present work is not only
intended for the young; everyone, it is hoped, will find in it something
interesting and also profitable, which, if not desired for self-instruction,
may at any rate be turned to account as a means of
teaching others that science, which is universal, can, when rightly
apprehended, preside even over our pleasures and amusements.</p>

<p>It may at the first glance appear paradoxical to combine Science
and Recreation, but we hope to show that true scientific recreation
is anything but the dry bones of learning. To those who study science
with us, we will point out first how easy and pleasant it is to watch
the sky and the plants and Nature generally in the open air. Then we
will carry our readers along with us, and by means of illustrations
and diagrams instruct them pleasantly in the <em>reasons for</em> things.
“How?” and “Why?” will be questions fully answered. Not only will the
usual scientific courses be touched upon, but we will show how Science
is applied to Domestic Economy. We will have Chemistry put before us
without needing a laboratory, and we will experiment in Physics without
elaborate apparatus. We will have, in short, a complete Encyclopædia of
Science free from dryness and technicalities—an amusing volume suited
to old and young who wish to find out what is going on around them in
their daily life in earth and sea and sky.</p>

<p>Bernard Palissy used to say that he wished “no other book than the
earth and the sky,” and that “it was given to all to read this wonderful book.”</p>

<p>It is indeed by the study of the material world that discoveries are
accomplished. Let an attentive observer watch a ray of light passing from
the air into water, and he will see it deviate from the straight line by refraction;
let him seek the origin of a sound, and he will discover that it results<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
from a shock or a vibration. This is physical science in its infancy. It is
said that Newton was led to discover the laws of universal gravitation by
beholding an apple fall to the ground, and that Montgolfier first dreamt of
air-balloons while watching fogs floating in the atmosphere. The idea of
the inner chamber of the eye may, in like manner, be developed in the mind
of any observer, who, seated beneath the shade of a tree, looks fixedly at
the round form of the sun through the openings in the leaves.</p>

<p>Every one, of course, may not possess the ambition to make such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
discoveries, but there is no one who cannot compel himself to learn to
enjoy the pleasure that can be derived from the observation of Nature.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that in order to cultivate science it is absolutely
necessary to have laboratories and scientific work-rooms. The book
of which Palissy spoke is ever present; its pages are always open, wherever
we turn our eyes or direct our steps. So we may hope to introduce all our
friends to a pleasant and lasting acquaintance with Dame Nature.</p>

<p>“But what <em>is</em> Nature?” We are fond of admiring Nature, and the
effects of certain causes in the world, and we want to know why things are
so. Very well—so you shall; and as to the question “What is Nature?”
we will endeavour to answer you at once.</p>

<p>Nature is the united totality of all that the various Senses can perceive.
In fact, all that cannot be made by man is termed “Nature”; <i>i.e.</i>, God’s
creation.</p>

<p>From the earliest ages man has sought to read the open leaves of the
Book of Nature, and even now, with all our attainments, we cannot grasp
all, or nearly all. One discovery only leads up to another. Cause and
Effect are followed up step by step till we lose ourselves in the search.
Every effect must have a cause. One thing depends upon another in the
world, and it does not need Divine revelation to tell us that. Nothing
happens by “mere chance.” “Chance!” said a Professor to us at the
University, “Chance!—Remember, there is no such thing in the world as
chance.”</p>

<p>Between our minds or consciousness and Nature are our Senses. We
feel, we see, we hear, we taste, we smell,—so it is only through the Senses
that we can come to any knowledge of the outer world. These attributes,
or Senses, act directly upon a certain “primary faculty” called Consciousness,
and thus we are enabled to understand what is going on around us. The
more this great existing faculty is educated and trained, the more useful it
will become. So if we accustom our minds to observation of Nature, we
shall find out certain causes and effects, and discover Objects. Now an
Object is a thing perceptible both to feeling and sight, and an Object
occupies space. Therefore there are objects Artificial as well as Natural.
The former are created by man from one or more Natural products.
Natural Objects are those such as trees, rocks, plants, and animals. We may
also class the heavenly bodies, etc., as Objects, though we cannot touch
them, but we can feel their effects, and see them. The <span class="smcap">Phenomena</span> of
Nature include those results which are perceptible by only one sense, as
thunder; light and sound may also be classed as Phenomena.</p>

<p>Take a familiar instance. A stone is a Natural Object. We take it
up, open our fingers, and it falls. The <em>motion</em> of that object is a Phenomenon.
We know it falls because we see it fall, and it possesses what we term
<em>weight</em>; but we cannot tell <em>why</em> it possesses weight.</p>

<p>[Professor Huxley says: “Stones do not fall to the ground in consequence
of a law of nature,” for a law is not a cause. “A law of nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
merely tells us what we may expect natural objects will do under certain
circumstances.”]</p>

<p>A cause of a Phenomenon being independent of human will is called a
<em>Force</em>, and the stone falls by the force of <em>Gravitation</em>, or that natural law
which compels every material object to approach every other material object.</p>

<p>A single Force may produce a great number of Phenomena.</p>

<p>Nature being revealed to us by Objects, and by means of Phenomena,
we have got already two Branches of Science extending from such Roots;
viz., <span class="smcap">Natural History</span>, the Science of Objects; and <span class="smcap">Natural Philosophy</span>,
the Science of Phenomena.</p>

<p>Both of these Branches have been subdivided thus:</p>

</table></div>

<p>These two great divisions comprehend, in their extended senses, all
that is known respecting the material world.</p>

<p>We have spoken of Objects. Objects occupy <em>Space</em>. What is Space?
Space is magnitude which can be conceived as extending in three directions—<em>Length</em>,
<em>Breadth</em>, and <em>Depth</em>. <span class="smcap">Matter</span> occupies portions of Space, which is
infinite. Matter, when finite, is termed a body or object. The general
properties of Matter are <em>Magnitude</em>, <em>Form</em>, <em>Impenetrability</em>, <em>Inertia</em>, <em>Divisibility</em>,
<em>Porosity</em>, <em>Elasticity</em>, <em>Compressibility</em>, <em>Expansibility</em>.</p>

<p>Matter is present in Nature in three conditions. We find it as a <span class="smcap">Solid</span>,
a <span class="smcap">Liquid</span>, and a <span class="smcap">Gas</span>. We shall explain the various properties of Solids,
Liquids, and Gases in their proper places (in Physics). To test the actual
existence of Matter in one or other of these forms our Senses help us. We
can touch a Solid, or taste it and see it. But touch is the test. We have
said that Matter possesses certain properties. We will examine these
briefly. The two which belong to all material bodies are Impenetrability
and Magnitude. You cannot, <em>strictly speaking</em>, penetrate Matter. You can
find the form of an object by touch or sight, but you cannot penetrate it.
You will think you can drive a nail or a screw into a board, but you cannot;
you only <em>displace</em> the fibres of the wood by the screw. Take water as
a very common instance. Water is Matter, for it occupies a certain space.
Water is <em>impenetrable</em>, for if you put your hand or foot into a basin full of
it, it will overflow, thus proving that you displace, and do not penetrate
it. It is almost impossible to compress water.</p>

<p><em>Divisibility</em> is another quality of Matter; and when we attempt to
show how far Matter can be divided, the brain refuses to grasp the infinity.
A pin’s head is a small object, but it is gigantic compared to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
animals, of which millions would occupy a space no larger than the
head of a pin. These tiny animals must contain organs and veins, etc.,
and those veins are full of blood globules. Professor Tyndall informs us
that a drop of blood contains three millions of red globules. So these
infinitesimally small animals must have millions of globules in their blood
also. Thus we see to what an extent, far beyond our Senses’ power to
grasp, Matter can be divided.</p>

<p>But there is something even more astonishing than this. It is stated
that there are more animals in the milt of a single codfish than there are
men in the world; and that <em>one grain of sand is larger than four millions of
these animals</em>! each of which must be possessed of life germs of an equal
amount, which would grow up as it grew to maturity. This carries us back
again, and</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Imagination’s utmost stretch</div>
<div class="verse indent2">In wonder dies away.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Or take other interesting facts. One hundred threads of the silkworm
must be placed side by side to make up the thickness of a line (—) about
1/25th of an inch; and metals can be drawn out to such exceeding fineness
that twelve hundred of the fine wires will occupy only the space of one
hundred silkworms’ threads, or one <em>millimetre</em>.</p>

<p><em>Porosity</em> is another attribute of Matter, for in all Matter there are pores,
or spaces, between the particles. Sometimes such openings are plainly
visible; in very “solid” bodies they are, to a great extent, indistinguishable.
But we know that the spaces exist, because we can <em>compress</em> the particles
together.</p>

<p><em>Inertia</em> is also a general property of Matter, and the meaning of the
term is “inactivity,” or passiveness—a want of power in an object to move,
or when moving, to stop of itself. It will come to rest apparently by itself,
but the resistance of the air and the friction of the ground, or the attraction
of the earth, will really occasion the stoppage of the object. We will speak
more fully of Inertia presently. Elasticity and Expansibility are evident in
fluids and gases.</p>

<p>We have thus introduced our readers to some of the most evident facts
connected with Matter. The various Forces and Phenomena of attraction
will be fully considered farther on; at present we are about to show our
readers how they may first profitably study Science in the open air for
themselves, and we will give them our experience of the Book of Nature.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 1.—Ants engaged in extracting aphides from a rose-tree (highly magnified)</div>
</div>

<p>Some years ago we were staying in Normandy, not far from the town of
C——, enjoying, in the midst of most cordial hospitality, the peacefulness
of country life; and my kind hosts, with me, took great pleasure in having
what we called “a course of science in the open air.” The recollections of
that time are some of the pleasantest in the whole course of my life, because
all our leisure was intelligently occupied. Each of us set himself to provide
the subject of some curious observation or instructive experiment; one made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
a collection of insects, another studied botany. In the daytime we might
have been seen examining, under a magnifying glass, the branch of a rose-tree,
from which the ants were endeavouring to extract the aphides<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> (fig. 1).
At night we admired through the telescope
the stars and planets that were visible; or
if the sky was not clear, we examined under
a strong magnifier grains of pollen from
flowers, or the <i>infusoria</i> in a drop of stagnant
water. Frequently some very insignificant
object became the occasion for some
scientific discussion, which terminated with an
experimental verification.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_007.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 2.—Experiment showing evaporation<br />
of water by leaves.</div>
</div>

<p>I recollect that one day one of us
remarked that after a week of dry weather
a stream of water had nearly dried up,
although sheltered by thick trees, which necessarily
impeded the calorific action of the
sun; and he expressed surprise at the rapid
evaporation. An agriculturist among the
company, however, drew his attention to the
fact that the roots of the trees were buried
in the course of the stream, and that, far
from preventing the evaporation of the water,
the leaves had contributed to accelerate it.
As the first speaker was not convinced, the
agriculturist, on our return to the house,
prepared an experiment represented in fig. 2.
He placed the branch of a tree covered with
foliage in a U-shaped tube, the two branches
of unequal diameter, and filled with water.
He placed the vegetable stem in the water,
and secured it to the tube by means of a
cork covered with a piece of india-rubber, and
tied tightly to make it hermetically closed.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the experiment
the water was level with <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> in the larger
branch of the tube, and level with <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> in the
smaller, rising by capillarity to a higher point

active that in a very short time we beheld the water sink to the points <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">C′</span>.</p>

<p>Thus did the excellent method of seeking the cause of phenomena by
experiments often lead us to interesting results. We had among us many
children and young people who had reached the age of ardent curiosity.
We took pleasure in pointing out to them the means of studying
natural science; and we were not long before feeling convinced that
our lessons out in the fields had much greater success than those given
between the four walls of a class-room. Insects were collected, and preserved
by being carefully placed in a small bottle, into which was let fall a drop
of sulphuret of carbon;<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> the insect was immediately asphyxiated, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
thus avoided the cruelty of passing a pin through a living body. Having
chased butterflies and insects, we next desired to study the aquatic creatures
which swarmed in the pools of the neighbourhood. For this purpose I
constructed a fishing-net fitted to an iron ring, and firmly secured to a
wooden handle. When this was plunged under the water and drawn quickly
out again, it came back full of slime. In the midst of this muddy substance
one generally succeeded in finding the hydrophilus, tadpoles, coleoptera,
many curious kinds of caddis-worms, tritons, and sometimes frogs, completely
astounded by the rapidity of their capture. All these creatures were
transported in a bottle to the house, and I then constructed, at small expense,
a glass aquarium, by means of the bell of a melon-glass turned upside down,
thus forming a transparent receptacle of considerable size. Four wooden
stakes were then fixed in the ground, and a plank with a circular hole nailed
on the top, in which the glass bell was placed. I next scattered some large
pebbles and shells at the bottom of the vase to form a stony bed, poured in
some water, placed a few reeds and water plants among the pebbles, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
threw a handful of water lentils on the surface; thus a comfortable home
was contrived for all the captured animals.<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The aquarium, when placed
under the shade of a fine tree in a rustic spot abounding with field flowers,
became a favourite rendezvous, and we often took pleasure in watching the
antics of the little inmates (fig. 3). Sometimes we beheld very sanguinary
scenes; the voracious hydrophilus would seize a poor defenceless tadpole,
and rend him in pieces for a meal without any compunction. The more
robust tritons defended themselves better, but sometimes they also succumbed
in the struggle.</p>

</div>

<p>The success of the aquarium was so complete that one of us resolved to
continue this museum in miniature, and one day provided himself with an
<em>insects palace</em>, which nearly made us forget the tadpoles and tritons. It was
a charming little cage, having the form of a house, covered with a roof;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
wires placed at equal distances forming the sides. In it was a large cricket
beside a leaf of lettuce, which served as his food (fig. 4). The little
creature moved up and down his prison, which was suspended from the
branch of a tree, and when one approached him very closely gave vent to
his lively chirps.</p>


<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_011.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 6.—Frog lying in wait for a fly.</div>
</div>

<p>The menagerie was soon further augmented by a hitherto unthought-of
object; namely, a frogs’ ladder. It was made with much skill. A large
bottle served for the base of the structure. The ladder which was fixed in
it was composed of the twigs of very small branches, recently cut from a
tree, and undivested of their bark, which gave to the little edifice a more
picturesque and rustic appearance. The pieces of wood, cleverly fixed into
two posts, conducted the green frogs (tree-frogs) on to a platform, whence
they ascended the steps of a genuine ladder. There they could disport
themselves at pleasure, or climb up further to a branch of birch-tree placed
upright in the centre of the bottle (fig. 5). A net with fine meshes prevented
the little animals from escaping. We gave the tree-frogs flies for
their food, and sometimes they caught them with remarkable dexterity. I
have often seen a frog when at liberty watching a fly, on which it pounces
as a cat does on a bird (fig. 6). The observations that we made on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
animals of our menagerie led us to undertake others of a very different
nature; I recollect particularly a case of catalepsy produced in a cock. I
will describe this remarkable experiment, certainly one of the most curious
we ever performed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_012.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 7.—Experiment of the cataleptic cock.</div>
</div>

<p>We place a cock on a table of dark colour, rest its beak on the surface,
where it is firmly held, and with a piece of chalk slowly draw a white line
in continuation from the beak, as shown in our engraving. If the crest is
thick, it is necessary to draw it back, so that the animal may follow with
his eyes the tracing of the line. When the line has reached a length of
about two feet the cock has become cataleptic. He is absolutely motionless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
his eyes are fixed, and he will remain from thirty to sixty seconds in the
same posture in which he had at first only been held by force. His head
remains resting on the table in the position shown in fig. 7. This experiment,
which we have successfully performed on different animals, can also
be accomplished by drawing a straight line with a piece of chalk on a slate.
M. Azam declares that the same result is also produced by drawing a
black line on a table of white wood. According to M. Balbiani, German
students had formerly a great predilection for this experiment, which they
always performed with marked success. Hens do not, when operated on,
fall into a cataleptic condition so easily as cocks; but they may often be
rendered motionless by holding their heads fixed in the same position for
several minutes. The facts we have just cited come properly under the
little studied phenomena, designated by M. Braid in 1843 by the title of
<cite>Hypnotism</cite>. MM. Littré and Ch. Robin have given a description of the
hypnotic condition in their <cite>Dictionnaire de Médecine</cite>.</p>

</div>

<p>If any shining object, such as a lancet, or a disc of silver-paper
gummed to a plate, is placed at about the distance of a foot from the eyes
of a person, slightly above the head, and the patient regards this object
fixedly, and without interruption for twenty or thirty minutes, he will
become gradually motionless, and in a great number of cases will fall into
a condition of torpor and genuine sleep. Dr. Braid affirms that under
such circumstances he has been able to perform surgical operations, without
the patient having any consciousness of pain. Later also, M. Azam has
proved the complete insensibility to pricking on the part of individuals
whom he has rendered cataleptic by the fixing of a brilliant object. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
experiment of the cataleptic cock was first described under the name of
<cite>Experimentum Mirabile</cite>, by P. Kircher, in his <cite>Ars Magna</cite>, published at
Rome in 1646. It evidently belongs to the class of experiments which
were performed at the Salpêtrière asylum at Paris, by M. Charcot, on
patients suffering from special disorders. It must now be evident to our
readers that our scientific occupations were sufficiently varied, and that we
easily found around us many objects of study. When the weather was wet
and cloudy we remained indoors, and devoted ourselves to microscopical
examinations. Everything that came under our hands, insects, vegetables,
etc., were worthy of observation. One day, while engaged over a microscopical
preparation, I was making use of one of those steel points generally
employed in such purposes, when happening to pass it accidentally beneath
the microscope, I was astonished to see how rough and uneven it appeared
when highly magnified. The idea then occurred to me to have recourse
to something still more pointed, and I was thus led to make comparisons
between the different objects represented in figs. 8 and 9. It will here
be seen how very coarse is the product of our industry when compared
with the product of Nature. No. 1 of fig. 8 represents the point of
a pin that has already been used, magnified 500 diameters. The point
is evidently slightly blunted and flattened. The malleable metal has
yielded a little under the pressure necessary to make it pass through a
material. No. 2 is a little more pointed; it is a needle. This, too, will be
seen to be defective when regarded by the aid of the microscope. On the
other hand, what fineness and delicacy do the rose thorn and wasp’s sting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
present when examined under the same magnifier! (See the two points
in fig. 9.)</p>

<p>An examination of this exact drawing has led me to make a calculation
which leads to rather curious results: at a half millimetre from the
point, the diameters of the four objects represented are in thousandths of a
millimetre respectively, 3·4; 2·2; 1·1; 0·38. The corresponding sections in
millionths of a square millimetre are: 907·92; 380·13; 95·03; 11·34; or,
in round numbers, 908; 380; 95; 11.</p>

<p>If one bears in mind, which is much below the truth, that the pressure
exercised on the point must be proportional to the section, and admitting
that a pressure of 11 centigrams suffices to thrust in the sting of a wasp half
a millimetre, it will require more than 9 grams of pressure to thrust in a
needle to the same extent. In fact, this latter figure is much too small, for
we have not taken into account the advantage resulting from the elongated
shape of the rose thorn, which renders it more favourable for penetration than
a needle through a drop of tallow.</p>

<p>It would be easy to extend observations of this kind to a number of
other objects, and the remarks I have just made on natural and artificial
points will apply incontestably to textures for example. There is no doubt
that the thread of a spider’s web would far surpass the thread of the finest
lace, and that art will always find itself completely distanced by nature.</p>

<p>We amused ourselves frequently by examining the <i>infusoria</i> which are so
easily procured by taking from some stagnant water the mucilage adhering
to the vegetation on the banks, or attached to the lower part of water lentils.
In this way we easily captured <i>infusoria</i>, which, when placed under a
strong magnifier, presented the most remarkable spectacle that one can
imagine. They are animalcules, having the form of transparent tulips
attached to a long stem. They form bunches which expand and lengthen;
then, suddenly, they are seen to contract with such considerable rapidity that
the eye can scarcely follow the movement, and all the stems and flower-bells
are folded up into the form of a ball. Then, in another moment, the stems
lengthen, and the tulip-bells open once more. One can easily encourage the
production of <i>infusoria</i> by constructing a small microscopic aquarium, in
which one arranges the centre in a manner favourable to the development
of the lowest organisms. It suffices to put a few leaves (a piece of parsley
answers the purpose perfectly)<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> in a small vase containing water (fig. 10),
over which a glass cover is placed, and it is then exposed to the rays of
the sun. In two or three days’ time, a drop of this water seen under the microscope
will exhibit <i>infusoria</i>. After a certain time, too, the different species
will begin to show themselves. Microscopical observations can be made on a
number of different objects. Expose to the air some flour moistened by water,
and before long a mouldiness will form on it; it is the <i>penicillium glaucum</i>, and
when examined under a magnifier of 200 to 300 diameters, cells are dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>tinguishable,
branching out from an organism remarkable for its simplicity.
We often amused ourselves by examining, almost at hazard, everything that
came within our reach, and sometimes we were led to make very instructive
investigations. When the sky was clear, and the weather favourable to
walking, we encouraged our young people to run about in the fields and
chase butterflies. The capture of butterflies is accomplished, as every one
knows, by means of a gauze net, with which we provided the children, and
the operation of chasing afforded them some very salutary exercise. It
sometimes happens that butterflies abound in such numbers, that it is comparatively
easy to capture them. During the month of June 1879, a large
part of Western Europe was thronged with swarms of <i>Vanessa algina</i>
butterflies, in such numbers that their appearance was regarded as an
important event, and attracted the lively attention of all entomologists
(fig. 11). This passage of butterflies provided the occasion for many interesting
studies on the part of naturalists.</p>

<p>We cannot point out too strongly to our readers that the essential condi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>tion
for the student of natural science, is the possession of that sacred fire which
imparts the energy and perseverance necessary for acquiring and enlarging
collections. It is also necessary that the investigator should furnish himself
with certain indispensable tools. For collecting plants, the botanist should be
armed with a pickaxe set in a thoroughly strong handle, a trowel, of which
there is a variety of shapes, and a knife with a sharp blade. A botanical
case must also be included, for carrying the plants. The geologist, or
mineralogist, needs no more elaborate instruments; a hammer, a chisel, and
a pickaxe with a sharp point for breaking the rocks, and a bag for carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the specimens, will complete his outfit. We amused ourselves by having
these instruments made by the blacksmith, sometimes even by manufacturing
them ourselves; they were simple, but solid, and admirably adapted to the
requirements of research. Often we directed our walks to the seashore,
where we liked to collect shells on the sandy beach, or fossils among the
cliffs and rocks. I recollect, in a walk I had taken some years previously
along the foot of the cliffs of Cape Blanc-Nez, near Calais, having found an
impression of an ammonite of remarkable size, which has often excited the
admiration of amateurs; this ammonite measured no less than twelve inches
in diameter. The rocks of Cape Grisnez, not far from Boulogne, also afford
the geologian the opportunity of a number of curious investigations. In the
Ardennes and the Alps I have frequently procured some fine mineral specimens;
in the first locality crystallized pyrites, in the second, fine fragments of
rock crystal (fig. 12). I did not fail to recount these successful expeditions
to the young people who accompanied me, and their ardour was thereby
inflamed by the hope that they also should find something valuable. It
often happened when the sun was powerful, and the air extremely calm, that
my young companions and I remarked some very beautiful effects of mirage
on the beach, due to the heating of the lower <em>strata</em> of the atmosphere.
The trees and houses appeared to be raised above a sheet of silver, in which
their reflections were visible as in a sheet of tranquil water. It can hardly
be believed how frequently the atmosphere affords interesting spectacles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
which pass unperceived before the eyes of those who know not how to
observe. I recollect having once beheld at Jersey a magnificent phenomenon
of this nature, on the 24th June, 1877, at eight o’clock in the evening:
it was a column of light which rose above the sinking sun like a sheaf of fire.
I was walking on the St. Helier pier, where there were also many promenaders,
but there were not more than two or three who regarded with me this mighty
spectacle. Columns and crosses of light are much more frequent than is
commonly supposed, but they often pass unperceived before indifferent
spectators. We will describe an example of this phenomenon observed
at Havre on the 7th May, 1877. The sun formed the centre of the cross,
which was of a yellow, golden colour. This cross had four branches. The
upper branch was much more brilliant than the others; its height was
about 15°. The lower branch was smaller, as seen in the sketch on
page 2, taken from nature by Monsieur Albert Tissandier. The two
horizontal branches were at times scarcely visible, and merged in a streak
of reddish-yellow colour, which covered a large part of the horizon. A
mass of cloud, which the setting sun tinged with a deep violet colour,
formed the foreground of the picture. The atmosphere over the sea was
very foggy. The phenomenon did not last more than a quarter of an hour,
but the conclusion of the spectacle was signalized by an interesting circumstance.
The two horizontal branches, and the lower branch of the luminous
cross, completely disappeared, whilst the upper branch remained alone for
some minutes longer. It had now the appearance of a <em>vertical column</em> rising
from the sun, like that which Cassini studied on the 21st May, 1672, and
that which M. Renon<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> and M. A. Guillemin observed on the 12th July,
1876.<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Vertical columns, which, it is well known, are extremely rare
phenomena, may therefore indicate the existence of a luminous cross, which
certain atmospheric conditions have rendered but partially visible.</p>

<p>How often one sees along the roads little whirlwinds of dust raised by
the wind accomplishing a rotatory movement, thus producing the imitation
of a waterspout! How often halos encompass with a circle of fire the sun
or the stars! How often we see the rainbow develop its iridescent beauties
in the midst of a body of air traversed by bright raindrops! And there
is not one of these great natural manifestations which may not give rise
to instructive observations, and become the object of study and research.
Thus, in walks and travels alike, the study of Science may always be
exercised; and this method of study and instruction in the open air contributes
both to health of body and of mind. As we consider the spectacles
which Nature spreads before us,—from the insect crawling on the blade
of grass, to the celestial bodies moving in the dome of the heavens,—we
feel a vivifying and salutary influence awaken in the mind. The habit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of observation, too, may be everywhere exercised—even in towns, where
Nature still asserts herself; as, for example, in displays of meteorological
phenomena. We will give an example of such.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_020.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 13.—Icicles on gas lamp.</div>
</div>

<p>The extraordinary abundance of snow which fell in Paris for more than
ten consecutive hours, commencing on the afternoon of Wednesday, January
22nd, 1880, will always be looked upon as memorable among the meteorological
events of the city of Paris. It was stated that in the centre of Paris,
the thickness of the snow that had fallen at different times exceeded fourteen
inches. The snow had been preceded by a fall of small transparent</p>

<p>icicles, of rather more than a millimetre in diameter, some having crystalline
facets. They formed on the surface of the ground a very slippery glazed
frost. On the evening of the 22nd January, flakes of snow began to
hover in the atmosphere like voluminous masses of wool. The greater part
of the gas-lamps were ornamented by frozen stalactites, which continually
attracted the attention of passers-by. The formation of these stalactites, of
which we give a specimen (fig. 13), is easy of explanation. The snow falling
on the glass of the lamp became heated by the flame of gas, melted, and
trickled down, freezing anew into the shape of a stalactite below the lamp,
at a temperature of 0° centigrade. Not only can meteorology be studied
in towns, but certain other branches of natural science—entomology, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
example. We will quote what a young student in science, M. A. Dubois,
says on this very subject: “Coleoptera,” he declares, “are to be met with
everywhere, and I think it may be useful to notice this fact, supporting it
by examples. I desire to prove that there are in the midst of our large
towns spots that remain unexplored, where some fine captures are to be
made. Let us visit, at certain times, the approaches to the quays, even at
low tide, and we shall be surprised to find there species which we have
searched for far and near.” This opinion is confirmed by the enumeration
of several interesting captures.</p>

<p>Was not the great Bacon right when he said, “For the keen observer,
nothing in Nature is mute”?</p>

TUMBLERS.</p>


<p>Having now introduced our readers to Science which they can find for
themselves in the open air, and the pursuit of which will both instruct and
amuse, we will proceed to investigate the Branch of Science called <span class="smcap">Physics</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Physics</span> may be briefly described as the Branch of Natural Science
which treats of such phenomena as are unaccompanied by any important
changes in the objects wherein such phenomena are observed.</p>

<p>For instance, the sounding of a bell or the falling of a stone are physical
phenomena, for the objects which cause the sound, or the fall, undergo no
change. Heat is set free when coal burns. This disengagement of heat is
a physical phenomenon; but the change during combustion which coal
undergoes is a <em>chemical</em> phenomenon. So the objects may be the same, but
the circumstances in which they are placed, and the forces which act upon
them, may change their appearance or position.</p>

<p>This brings us at once to the <em>Forces of Nature</em>, which are three in
number; viz., Gravity, Cohesion, and Affinity, or Chemical Attraction. The
phenomena connected with the last-named forms the Science of <em>Chemistry</em>.
We give these three Forces these names. But first we must see what is
Force, for this is very important. Force is a <span class="smcap lowercase">CAUSE</span>—the cause of Motion
or of Rest. This may appear paradoxical, but a little reflection will prove
it. It requires force to set any object in motion, and this body would never
stop unless some other force or forces prevented its movement beyond a
certain point. Force is therefore the cause of a change of “state” in matter.</p>

<p>We have said there are three forces in nature. The first is Gravity, or
the attraction of particles at a distance from each other. We may say that
Gravity, or Gravitation, is the mutual attraction between different portions of
matter acting at all distances,—the force of attraction being, of course, in
proportion to the mass of the bodies respectively. The greatest body is the
Earth, so far as our purposes are concerned. So the attraction of the Earth
is <em>Gravity</em>, or what we call <em>Weight</em>.</p>

<p>We can easily prove this. We know if we jump from a chair we shall
come to the floor; and if there were nothing between us and the actual ground
sufficient to sustain the force of the attracting power of the earth, we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
fall to the earth’s surface. In a teacup the spoon will attract air bubbles,
and large air bubbles will attract small ones, till we find a small mass of
bubbles formed in the centre of the cup of tea. Divide this bubble, and the
component parts will rush to the sides of the cup. This form of attraction
is illustrated by the accompanying diagrams.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_023a.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 14.</div>
</div>

<p>Suppose two balls of equal magnitude, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> (fig. 14). These being of
equal magnitude, attract each other with equal force, and will meet, if not
opposed, at a point (<span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>) half-way between the two. But they do not meet,
because the attraction of the earth is greater than the attraction they relatively
and collectively exercise towards each other. But if the size of the
balls be different, the attraction of the greater will be more evident, as shown
below, where the points of meeting are indicated respectively (figs. 15 and 16).
These experiments will illustrate the phenomena of <em>falling bodies</em>. Gravity is
the cause of this, because every object on the surface of the earth is very
much smaller than the earth itself, and therefore all bodies <em>fall</em> towards the
centre of the earth. A certain time is thus occupied, and we can find the
<em>velocity</em> or rapidity of a falling body very easily. On the earth a body, if
let fall, will pass through a space sixteen feet in the first second; and as the
attraction of the earth still continues and is exercised upon a body already
in rapid motion, this rate of progress must be proportionately increased.
Just as when steam is kept up in an engine running down hill, the velocity
of the train will rapidly increase as it descends the gradient.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_023.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Figs. 15 and 16.</div>
</div>

<p>A body falling, then, descends sixteen feet in the first second, and for
every succeeding second it assumes a greater velocity. The distance the
body travels has been calculated, and the space it passes through has been
found to <em>increase in proportion to the square of the time it takes to fall</em>. For
instance, suppose you drop a stone from the top of a cliff to the beach, and
it occupies two seconds in falling, if you multiply 2 × 2, and the result by
sixteen, you will find how high the cliff is: in this (supposed) case it is
(omitting decimals) sixty-four feet high. The depth of a well can also be
ascertained in the same way, leaving out the effect of air resistance.</p>

<p>But if we go up into the air, the force of gravity will be diminished.
The attraction will be less, because we are more distant from the centre of
the earth. This decrease is scarcely, if at all, perceptible, even on very
high mountains, because their size is not great in comparison with the mass
of the earth’s surface. The rule for this is <em>that gravity decreases in proportion
to the square of the distance</em>. So that if at a certain distance from the earth’s
surface the force of attraction be 1, if the distance be <em>doubled</em> the attraction
will be only <em>one quarter</em> as much as before—not one-half.</p>

<p>Gravity has exactly the same influence upon <em>all</em> bodies, and the force
of the attraction is in proportion to the mass. All bodies of equal mass will
fall in the same time in a given distance. Two coins (or a coin and a feather
<i lang="la">in vacuo</i>) will fall together. But in the air the feather will remain far behind
the coin, because nearly all the atoms of the former are resisted by the air,
while in the coin only some particles are exposed to the resistance, the <em>density</em>
of the latter preventing the air from reaching more than a few atoms, comparatively
speaking. The theory of weight and gravitation, and experiments
relating to the falling of bodies, may be easily demonstrated with ordinary
objects that we have at hand. I take a halfpenny and a piece of paper,
which I cut in the shape of the coin, and holding them side by side, I drop
them simultaneously; the halfpenny reaches the ground some time before
the paper, a result quite in accordance with the laws of gravitation, as one
must bear in mind the presence of air, and the different resistance it offers
to two bodies differing in density. I next place the paper disc on the upper
surface of the piece of money, and then drop them simultaneously. The two
objects now reach the ground at the same time, the paper, in contact with the
halfpenny, being preserved from the action of the air. This experiment is
so well known that we need not further discuss it; but it must be plainly
evident that it is capable of development in experiments on phenomena
relating to falling bodies.<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> When a body influenced by the action of a force
acts, in its turn, upon another, the latter reacts in an opposite manner upon
the first, and with the same intensity.</p>

<p><em>The Attraction of Cohesion</em> is the attraction of particles of bodies to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
each other at very small distances apart. Cohesion has received various
names in order to express its various degrees. For instance, we say a body
is tough or brittle, or soft or hard, according to the degrees of cohesion the
particles exercise. We know if we break a glass we destroy the cohesion;
the particles cannot be reunited. Most Liquid particles can be united, but
not all. Oil will not mix with water.</p>

<p>The force of cohesion depends upon heat. Heat expands everything,
and the cohesion diminishes as temperature increases.</p>

<p>There are some objects or substances upon the earth the particles
of which adhere much more closely than others, and can only, with very
great difficulty, be separated. These are termed <em>Solids</em>. There are other
substances whose particles can easily be divided, or their position altered.
These are called <em>Fluids</em>. A third class seem to have little or no cohesion
at all. These are termed <em>Gases</em>.</p>

<p>Adhesion is also a form of attraction, and is cohesion existing on the
surfaces of two bodies. When a fluid adheres to a solid we say the solid <em>is
wet</em>. We turn this natural adhesion to our own purposes in many ways,—we
whitewash our walls, and paint our houses; we paste our papers together, etc.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many fluids will hot adhere. Oil and water have
already been instanced. Mercury will not stick to a glass tube, nor will
the oiled glass tube retain any water. We can show the attraction and
repulsion in the following manner:—Let one glass tube be dipped into water
and another into mercury, you will see that the water will ascend slightly
at the side, owing to the attraction of the glass, while the mercury will
be higher in the centre, for it possesses no attraction for the glass (fig. 17).
If small, or what are termed capillary (or hair) tubes, be used (fig. 18), the
water will rise up in the one tube, while in the other the mercury will
remain lower than the mercury outside the tube. (See <a href="#Page_64"><cite>Capillarity</cite></a>.)</p>

<p><em>Chemical Attraction</em> is the force by which two different bodies unite to
form a new and different body from either. This force will be fully considered
in <span class="smcap">Chemistry</span>, in a future part.</p>

<p>It is needless for us to dwell upon the uses of these Forces of Nature.
Gravity and Cohesion being left out of our world, we can imagine the result.
The earth and sun and planets would wander aimlessly about; we should
float away into space, and everything would fall to pieces, while our bodies
would dissolve into their component parts.</p>

<p><em>The Balance and Centre of Gravity.</em>—We have spoken at some length
about Gravity, and now we must say something respecting that point called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the <em>Centre of Gravity</em>, and the <em>Balance</em>, and upon the latter we have a few
remarks to make first, for a well-adjusted balance is a most useful thing,
and we will show you how to make one, and then proceed to our illustrations
of the Centre of Gravity, and explain it.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 19.—Torsion balance, which can easily be constructed, capable of weighing a milligram one-tenth of full size.</div>
</div>

<p>All those who cultivate experimental science are aware that it is useful
to unite with theoretical ideas that manual dexterity which is acquired by
the student accustoming himself to practical operations. One cannot too
strongly urge both chemists and physicists to exercise themselves in the construction
of the appliances they require, and also to modify those already
existing, which may be adapted to their wants. In a large number of cases
it is possible to manufacture, at small expense, delicate instruments, capable
of rendering the same service as the most elaborate apparatus. Important
scientific labours have often been undertaken by men whose laboratories were
most simple, who, by means of skill and perseverance, knew how to do great
things with small resources. A delicate balance, for instance, indispensable
alike to chemist and physicist, can be manufactured at little cost in different
ways. A thin platinum wire and a piece of wood is all that is needed to make
a balance capable of weighing a milligram; and to make a very sensitive
hydrostatic balance, little is required besides a glass balloon. Fig. 19
represents a small torsion balance of extreme simplicity. A thin platinum
wire is stretched horizontally through two staples, from the wooden supports,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span>, which are fixed in a deal board. A very thin, delicate lever, <span class="smcap lowercase">C D</span>,
cut in wood, or made with a wisp of straw, is fixed in the centre of the
platinum wire by means of a small clip, which secures it firmly. This lever is
placed in such a manner that it is raised perceptibly out of the horizontal line.
At <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span> is fixed a paper scale, on which is put the weight of a centigram. The
lever is lowered to a certain point, slightly twisting the platinum wire. Near
the end of the lever a piece of wood, <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span>, is fixed, on which is marked the
extreme point of its movements. Ten equi-distant divisions are marked
between these two points, which represent the distance traversed by the
lever under the weight of the milligram. If a smaller weight than a
centigram is placed on the paper scale the lever falls, and balances itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
after a few oscillations. If it falls four divisions, it is evident that the substance
weighs four milligrams. Taking a rather thicker platinum wire, to
which a shorter lever must be adapted, one can weigh the decigram, and
so on. It would be an easy matter, also, to make, on the same model,
balances for weighing considerable weights. The platinum wire should be
replaced by iron wires of larger diameter, firmly stretched, and the lever
should be made of a piece of very resisting wood. One can also, by
adaptation, find the exact value of the most trifling weights. By lengthening
a very fine platinum wire several yards, and adapting a long, slender lever,
it will not be impossible to ascertain the tenth of a milligram. In this latter
case the balance can be set when it is wanted.</p>

<img src="images/i_027.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 20.—Nicholson’s Areometer, contrived
to serve as a balance.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 20 represents Nicholson’s Areometer, which any one may
construct for himself, and which, as it is here represented,
constitutes another kind of balance. A glass balloon, filled with air,
is hermetically closed with a cork, through which is passed a cylinder
of wood, surmounted by a wooden disc, <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>.
The apparatus is terminated at its lower end by a small tray, <span
class="smcap">C</span>, on which one can put pieces of lead in variable
quantities. It is then plunged into a glass filled with water. The
pieces of lead on the tray, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, are added by
degrees, until the stem of the areometer rises almost entirely above
the level of the water; it is next passed through a ring, which keeps
it in position, and which is fastened to the upper part of the glass by
means of four iron wires in the shape of a cross. The stem is divided
in such a way that the space comprised in each division represents
the volume of a cubic centimetre. Thus arranged, the apparatus
constitutes a balance. The object to be weighed is placed on the disc,
<span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>, and the areometer sinks in the water,
oscillates, and then remains in equilibrium. If the stem sinks five
divisions, it is evident that the weight of the object corresponds to
that of five cubic centimetres of displaced water, or five grams.</p>

<p>It is obvious, therefore, from the preceding examples, that it is not
impossible to construct a weighing apparatus with ordinary and very inexpensive
objects. We can, in the same way, show that it is possible to
perform instructive experiments with no appliances at all, or, at any rate,
with common things, such as everyone has at hand. The lamented Balard,
whose loss science has had recently to deplore, excelled in chemical experiments
without a laboratory; fragments of broken glass or earthenware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
were used by him for improvising retorts, bottles and vases for forming
precipitates, and carrying on many important operations.</p>

<p>Scheele also operated in like manner; he knew how to make great
discoveries with the humblest appliances and most slender resources. One
cannot too earnestly endeavour to imitate such leaders, both in teaching
others and instructing oneself.</p>

<p>The laws relating to the weight of bodies, the centre of gravity, and
stable or unstable equilibrium, may be easily taught and demonstrated by
means of a number of very familiar objects. By putting into the hands
of a child a box of soldiers cut in elder-wood, the end of each fixed into
half a bullet, we provide him with the means of making some easy
experiments on the centre of gravity. According to some authorities
on equilibrium, it is not impossible, with a little patience and delicacy of
manipulation, to keep an egg balanced on one of its ends. This
experiment should be performed on a perfectly horizontal surface, a marble
chimney-piece, for example. If one can succeed in keeping the egg up, it
is, according to the most elementary principles of physics, because the
vertical line of the centre of gravity passes through the point of contact
between the end of the egg and the surface on which it rests.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_028.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 21.—Experiment on “centre of gravity.”</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 21 reproduces a curious experiment in equilibrium, which is
performed with great facility. Two forks are stuck into a cork, and the
cork is placed on the brim of the neck of a bottle. The forks and the cork
form a whole, of which the centre of gravity is fixed over the point of
support. We can bend the bottle, empty it even, if it contains fluid,
without the little construction over its mouth being in the least disturbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
from its balance. The vertical line of the centre of gravity passes through
the point of support, and the forks oscillate with the cork, which serves as
their support, thus forming a movable structure, but much more stable than
one is inclined to suppose. This curious experiment is often performed by
conjurors, who inform their audience, that they will undertake to empty the
bottle without disturbing the cork. If a woodcock has been served for
dinner, or any other bird with a long beak, take off the head at the extreme
end of the neck; then split a cork so that you can insert into it the neck of
the bird, which must be tightly clipped to keep it in place; two forks are
then fixed into the cork, exactly as in the preceding example, and into the
bottom of the cork a pin is inserted. This little contrivance is next placed
on a piece of money, which has been put on the opening of the neck of the
bottle, and when it is fairly balanced, we give it a rotatory movement, by
pushing one of the forks as rapidly as we please, but as much as possible
without any jerk (fig. 22). We then see the two forks, and the cork
surmounted by the woodcock’s head, turning on the slender pivot of a pin.
Nothing can be more comical than to witness the long beak of the bird
turning round and round, successively facing all the company assembled
round the table, sometimes with a little oscillation, which gives it an almost
lifelike appearance. This rotatory movement will last some time, and wagers
are often laid as to which of the company the beak will point at when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
stops. In laboratories, wooden cylinders are often to be seen which will
ascend an inclined plane without any impulsion. This appears very surprising
at first, but astonishment ceases when we perceive that the centre of gravity
is close to the end of the cylinder, because of a piece of lead, which has
been fixed in it.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 23.—Automatic puppets.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 23 gives a very exact representation of a plaything which was
sold extensively on the Boulevards at Paris at the beginning of the New
Year. This little contrivance, which has been known for some time, is one
of the most charming applications of the principles relating to the centre of
gravity. With a little skill, any one may construct it for himself. It consists
of two little puppets, which turn round axles adapted to two parallel
tubes containing mercury. When we place the little contrivance in the
position of fig. 24, the mercury being at <i>a</i>, the two dolls remain motionless,
but if we lower the doll <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, so that it stands on the second step (No. 2) of
the flight, as indicated in fig. 25, the mercury descends to <i>b</i> at the other end
of the tube; the centre of gravity is suddenly displaced; the doll <span class="smcap lowercase">R</span> then
accomplishes a rotatory movement, as shown by the arrow in fig. 25, and
finally alights on step No. 3. The same movement is also effected by the
doll <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, and so on, as many times as there are steps. The dolls may be
replaced by a hollow cylinder of cartridge paper closed at both ends, and
containing a marble; the cylinder, when placed vertically on an inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
plane, descends in the same way as the puppets. The laws of equilibrium
and displacement of the centre of gravity, are rigorously observed by
jugglers, who achieve many wonderful feats, generally facilitated by the
rotatory motion given to the bodies on which they operate, which brings
into play the centrifugal force. The juggler who balances on his forehead
a slender rod, on the end of which a plate turns round, would never succeed
in the experiment if the plate did not turn on its axis with great rapidity.
But by quick rotation the centre of gravity is kept near the point of
support. We need hardly remark, too, that it is the motion of a top that
tends to keep it in a vertical position.</p>

<p>Many experiments in mechanical physics may occur to one’s mind.
To conclude the enumeration of those we have collected on the subject, I
will describe the method of lifting a glass bottle full of water by means of
a simple wisp of straw. The straw is bent before being passed into the
bottle of water, so that, when it is lifted, the centre of gravity is displaced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and brought directly under the point of suspension. Fig. 26 shows the
method of operation very plainly. It is well to have at hand several pieces
of straw perfectly intact, and free from cracks, in case the experiment does
not succeed with the first attempt.</p>

<p>Having now seen how this point we call the centre of gravity acts, we
may briefly explain it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_032.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 26.—Lifting a bottle with a single straw.</div>
</div>

<p>The centre of gravity of a body is that point in which the sum of the
forces of gravity, acting upon all the particles, may be said to be united. We
know the attraction of the earth causes bodies to have a property we call
<em>Weight</em>. This property of weight presses upon every particle of the body,
and acts upon them as parallel forces. For if a stone be broken all the portions
will equal the weight of the stone; and if some of them be suspended, it will
be seen that they hang parallel to each other, so we may call these weights
parallel forces united in the whole stone, and equal to a single resultant.
Now, to find the centre of gravity, we must suspend the body, and it will
hang in a certain direction. Draw a line from the point of suspension, and
suspend the body again: a line drawn from that point of suspension will
pass through the same place as the former line did, and so on. That point
is the centre of gravity of that suspended body. If the form of it be regular,
like a ball or cylinder, the centre of gravity is the same as the mathematically
central point. In such forms as pyramids it will be found near the largest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
mass; viz., at the bases, about one-fourth of the distance between the apex
and the centre of gravity of the base.</p>

<p>When the centre of gravity of any body is supported, that body cannot
fall. So the well-known leaning towers are perfectly safe, because their lines
of direction fall within the bases. The centre of gravity is in the centre of
the leaning figure. The line of direction drawn vertically from that point
falls within the base; but if the tower were built up higher, so that the centre
of gravity were higher, then the structure would fall, because the line of direction
would fall without the base.</p>

<p>We see that animals (and men) are continually altering the position of
the centre of gravity; for if a man bears a load he will lean forward, and if
he takes up a can of water in one hand he will extend the other to preserve
his balance or equilibrium.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_033.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 27.—Balancing a weight on a nail and key.</div>
</div>

<p>The experiment shown in the accompanying illustration is apparently
very difficult, but it will be found easy enough in practice if the hand be
steady. Take a key, and by means of a crooked nail, or “holdfast,” attach
it to a bar of wood by a string tied tightly round the bar, as in the picture.
To the other extremity of the bar attach a weight, and then drive a large-headed
nail into the table. It will be found that the key will balance, and
even move upon the head of the nail, without falling. The weight is under
the table, and the centre of gravity is exactly beneath the point of suspension.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Another simple experiment may prove amusing. Into a piece of wood
insert the points of two knives, and at the centre of the end of the bar insert
a needle between the knife handles. The wood and the knives may then be
balanced on another needle fixed in a cork at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>.</p>

<p>We may conclude this chapter by summing up in a few words what
the Centre of Gravity is. We can define it as “that point in a body upon
which the body, acted on solely by the force of gravity, will balance itself
in all positions.” Such a point exists in every body, and equally in a
number of bodies fastened tightly together. The Centre of Gravity has by
some writers been denominated the <em>Centre of Parallel Forces</em>, or the <em>Centre of
Magnitude</em>, but the Centre of Gravity is the most usual and best understood
term.</p>

<p class="hang">SOME PROPERTIES OF SOLID BODIES—INERTIA—MOTION—FRICTION—THE
PENDULUM—EQUILIBRIUM.</p>


<p>Those who have followed us through the preceding pages have now, we hope,
some ideas upon Gravity and the Forces of Nature. In speaking of Forces
we said “Force was a cause of Motion.” Let us now consider Inertia, and
Motion with its accompanying opponent, Friction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_035.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 29.—Shock communicated by elasticity.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Inertia</span> is the passiveness of Matter. This perfect indifference to either
rest or motion makes the great distinction between living and lifeless matter.
Inertia, or <em>Vis Inertia</em>, is this passiveness. Now, to overcome this indifference
we must use force, and when we have applied force to matter we set it
in motion; that is, we move it. When we move it we find a certain resistance
which is always proportionate to the force applied. In mechanics this is
termed <em>Action</em>, and <em>Reaction</em>, which are always equal forces acting in opposite
directions. This is Newton’s law, and may be explained by a “weight” on
a table, which presses against the table with the same force with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the table presses against the “weight”; or when you strike a ball, it strikes
the hand with the same force.</p>

<p>We can communicate motion by elasticity. For instance, if we place
a number of coins upon a table touching each other and in a straight line,
and strike the last coin of the line by pushing another sharply against it, the
piece at the opposite extremity will slip out of its place from the effect of
the shock transmitted by the coin at the other end (fig. 29).</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_036.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 30.—Experiment to illustrate inertia.</div>
</div>

<p>When two forces act upon a body at the same time, it takes a direction
intermediate. This is known as the resultant. The enormous forces exercised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
by the heavenly bodies will be treated of later. We will first consider
<em>Inertia</em>.</p>

<p>There are several experiments relating to the subject of Inertia which
may be performed. I once witnessed one quite accidentally when taking a
walk.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_037.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 31.—Another experiment on the same subject.</div>
</div>

<p>I was one day passing the Observatory at Paris, when I noticed a
number of people collected round a professor, who after executing several
juggling tricks, proceeded to perform the curious experiment I am about to
describe. He took a broomstick and placed it horizontally, passing the
ends through two paper rings. He then asked two children to hold the
paper rings by means of two razors, so that the rings rested on the blade.
This done, the operator took a stout stick, and, with all his strength, struck
the broomstick in the centre; it was broken into shivers, but the paper rings
were not torn in the least, or even cut by the razors! One of my friends,
M. M——, a painter, showed me how to perform this experiment as
represented in the illustration (fig. 30). A needle is fixed at each end of the
broomstick, and these needles are made to rest on two glasses, placed on
chairs; the needles alone must be in contact with the glasses. If the broomstick
is then struck violently with another stout stick, the former will be
broken, but the glasses will remain intact. The experiment answers all the
better the more energetic the action. It is explained by the resistance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
inertia in the broomstick. The shock suddenly given, the impulse has not
time to pass on from the particles directly affected to the adjacent particles;
the former separate before the movement can be transmitted to the glasses
serving as supports.<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 32.—Extracting a “man” from a pile of draughts without overturning the pile.</div>
</div>

<p>The experiment represented in fig. 31 is of the same nature. A
wooden ball is suspended from the ceiling by a rather slender thread, and a
similar thread is attached to the lower end of the ball. If the lower thread
is pulled forcibly it will break, as shown in the illustration; the movement
communicated to it has not time to pass into the ball; if, on the contrary,
it is pulled very gradually and without any shock, the upper thread instead
will break, because in this case it supports the weight of the ball. Motion is
not imparted simultaneously to all parts of a body, but only to the particles
first exposed to a blow, for instance. One might multiply examples of this.
If a bullet be shot from a gun, it will make a round hole in a piece of wood
or glass, whilst if thrown by the hand,—that is to say, with much less force,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>—
it will shiver the wood or the pane of glass to pieces. When the celerity of
the motive force is very great, the particles directly affected are disturbed so
quickly that they separate from the adjacent particles before there is time for
the movement to be communicated to the latter.</p>

<p>It is possible, for the same reason, to extract from a pile of money a
piece placed in the middle of the pile without overturning the others. It
suffices to move them forcibly and quickly with a flat wooden ruler. The
experiment succeeds very well also if performed with draughtsmen piled
up on the draught-board (fig. 32).</p>

napkin. It is covered with a glass, turned over so that its brim rests on two
penny pieces. The problem to be solved is how to extract the sixpence from
underneath the glass without touching it, or slipping anything beneath it.
To do this it is necessary to scratch the cloth with the nail of the forefinger;
the elasticity of the material communicates the movement to the sixpence,
which slowly moves in the direction of the finger, until it finally comes
out completely from beneath the glass.</p>

<p>We may give another experiment concerning Inertia. Take a strip of
paper, and upon it place a coin, on a marble chimney-piece, as in the illustration.
If, holding the paper in the left hand, you strike it rapidly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
forcibly, you will be enabled to draw away the paper without causing the coin
(say a five-shilling-piece) to fall down (fig. 34).</p>

<p>It is not impossible to draw away a napkin laid as a tablecloth for one
person’s dinner, without disturbing the various articles laid upon it. A quick
motion is all that is necessary, keeping the napkin tightly extended by the
hands at the same time. This latter experiment, however, is not recommended
to boys home for the holidays, as they may unwillingly practise a
feat analogous to that executed by Humpty-Dumpty, and find equal difficulty
to match the pieces.</p>

<p>We will now examine the term <em>Motion</em>. A body is said to be in
motion when it changes its position in relation to surrounding objects. To
perceive motion the surrounding objects must be relatively at rest, for if they
all hurried along at the same rate no motion would be perceptible. This is
evident, for when we stand still trees and houses appear stationary, as do we
ourselves, but we know we all are rushing round with the earth, though our
<em>relative</em> positions are unchanged. Hence there is no <em>absolute</em> rest.</p>

<p>What are the causes of motion?—Gravity is one. The influence of
heat, which is itself caused by the motion of atoms, the effects of electricity,
etc., and finally, the power of force in men or animals—any of these causes
will produce motion. But a body at rest cannot put itself in motion, nor
can a body in motion stop itself, or change its condition of motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>But you may say a body will stop itself. Your ball on the ground, or
even upon ice, will eventually come to a stop. We fire a bullet, and it will
stop in time. We reply it does not stop of itself, The resistance of the Air
and Friction tend to bring the body in motion to a state of rest. In the case
of a bullet gravity brings it down.</p>

<p>There is no need to insist upon the resistance offered by the air even
when it is not rushing violently past to fill up a vacuum beyond us, and
called a breeze, or high wind. But we may say something of <em>Friction</em>.</p>

<p>Friction is derived from the Latin <i lang="la">frico</i>, to rub, and expresses the
resistance to motion which arises from uneven surfaces. It is a passive
resistance, and depends upon the force which keeps the bodies together.
Thus a train running upon a smooth iron rail would never be able to proceed
but for friction, which gives the necessary purchase or grip to the wheel and
rail in contact.</p>

<p>No surface is perfectly smooth, for we must push a body upon the
smoothest surface we possess. Friction tends to resist motion always, and is
the cause of a great loss of power in mechanics, though it is employed to
stop motion by certain appliances, such as “brakes” and “drags,” for sliding
friction is greater than rolling friction. But without friction most structures
would fall to pieces, and all forward motion would cease. So though it is
an inconvenient force to overcome, we could not do without it.</p>

<p>If a body is set in motion, we see that the tendency of it is to go on for
ever. Such, indeed, is the case with the stars; but so long as we are within
the influence of the earth’s attraction, we cannot expect such a result. We
know now what motion is; we must also, to understand it perfectly, consider
its direction and its velocity.</p>

<p>The line which indicates the way from the starting point to the end is
the <em>direction</em> of the object in motion, and the rate it moves at its <em>velocity</em>.
The latter is calculated at so many miles an hour, as a train; or so many
feet in a second if the object be a shot, or other very rapidly-moving body.
In equal velocity the same distance is traversed in the same time; and so if
a train run a mile in a minute, we know it will travel sixty miles in an hour,
and is therefore during that minute going at <em>the rate</em> of sixty miles an hour.
We have already spoken of the velocity of a stone falling from a cliff as
sixteen feet in a second, and a stone thrown into the air to rise sixteen feet
will be a second in going up, and a second in descending. But the velocity
will be accelerated in the descent after the first second of time, and retarded
in the upward cast by gravity. So we have two terms—<em>accelerated</em> and
<em>retarded</em> velocity—used to express an increased or decreased force of attraction.</p>

<p>Perpetual motion has often been sought, but never discovered, nor will
it ever be till the elixir of life has been found. It is quite impossible to
construct any machine that will work without friction; if any work be done
energy will be expended and transformed into other energy, so the total
must be diminished by so much as was employed to transform the remainder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
No body can give unlimited work, therefore the perpetual motion theory is
untenable and impossible.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_042a.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 35.—The pendulum.</div>
</div>

<p>The <em>pendulum</em> is considered the nearest approach to perpetual
motion. This is so well known that no description is needed, but we
may say a few words concerning it. By the diagram, we see that if we
lift the ball to <i>b</i>, and let it fall, it will descend to <i>l</i>, and
pass it to <i>a</i> opposite, nearly as far from <i>l</i> as <i>b</i> is from it. So
the oscillations will continue, each beat being less and less, till
rest is reached by the action of gravity (page 23). Were it not for
friction and the pressure of the air, the oscillations would continue
for ever; as it is, it declines by shorter swings till it remains in
equilibrium.</p>

<p>The seconds’ pendulum oscillates sixty times an hour, and must be of
a certain length in certain places. In London it is 39·1393 inches, and
furnishes a certain standard of length, and by an Act of Parliament the yard
is divided into 36 parts, and 39·1393 such parts make the seconds’ pendulum
in the latitude of London (<i lang="la">in vacuo</i>) in a temperature of 62°.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_042.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 36.—Centrifugal Force.</div>
</div>

<p>But the same pendulum will not perform the same number of oscillations
in one minute in all parts of the globe. At the equator they will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
less, and at the pole more. Thus it was discovered that, as the movements
of the pendulum are dependent upon the force of gravity, and as this force
decreases the farther we get from the centre of the earth, the equator must
be farther from the earth’s centre than the poles, and therefore the poles
must be depressed. The decline of the pendulum at the equator is also, in a
measure, due to Centrifugal Force.</p>

<p><em>Centrifugal Force</em>, which means “flying from the centre,” is the force
which causes an object to describe a circle with uniform velocity, and fly
away from the centre; the force that counteracts it is called the <em>centripetal</em>
force. A very simple experiment will illustrate it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_043.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 37.—Another illustration of centrifugal force.</div>
</div>

<p>To represent its action, we shall have recourse to an ordinary glass
tumbler placed on a round piece of cardboard, held firmly in place by cords.
Some water is poured in the glass, and we then show that it can be swung
to and fro and round without the water being spilt, even when the glass is
upside down (fig. 36).</p>

<p>Another experiment on the same subject is as shown in the above illustration,
by which a napkin ring can be kept in revolution around the forefinger,
and by a continued force the ring may be even held suspended at
the tip of the finger, apparently in the air, without support (fig. 37).</p>

<p class="center">GASES AND LIQUIDS—PRESSURE OF THE AIR—EXPERIMENTS.</p>


<p>We have more than once referred to the pressure of the air which exerts
a great influence upon bodies in motion, but a few experiments will make
this more obvious, and clearly demonstrate the fact. We have also told you
some of the properties of Solids, such as Weight, Inertia, Friction, and Resistance,
or Strength. Solids also, as we have seen, occupy space, and cannot
be readily compressed, nor bent to other shapes. Now the subject of the
Pressure of the Air leads us to the other forms of Matter; namely, Gases
and Liquids, which will be found very interesting to study.</p>

<p>The force of air can very soon be shown as acting with considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
pressure upon an egg in a glass. By blowing in a claret glass containing a
hard-boiled egg, it is possible to cause the egg to jump out of the glass; and
with practice and strength of lungs it is not impossible to make it pass from
one glass to another, as per illustration (fig. 38).</p>

<p>The force of heated air ascending can also be ascertained by cutting up
a card into a spiral, and holding it above the flame of a lamp (fig. 39). The
spiral, if lightly poised, will turn round rapidly.</p>

<p>Now let us turn to a few experiments with the air, which is composed
in two gases, Oxygen and Nitrogen, of which we shall hear more when we
come to <span class="smcap">Chemistry</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>It is not intended here to prosecute researches, but rather to sketch a
programme for instruction, based on amusing experiments in Physics,
performed without apparatus. The greater part of these experiments are
probably well known, and we desire to say that we merely claim to have
collected and arranged them for our descriptions. We must also add that
we have performed and verified these experiments; the reader, therefore,
can attempt them with every certainty of success. We will suppose that we
are addressing a young auditory, and commence our course of Physics with
some facts relating to the pressure of air. A wine glass, a plate, and water,
will serve for our first experiments. Pour some water on the plate, light
a piece of paper resting on a cork, and cover the flame with the glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
which I turn upside down (fig. 40). What follows?—The water rises in
the glass. Why?—Because the burning of the paper having absorbed a part
of the oxygen, and the volume of confined gas being diminished, the pressure
of the outer air has driven back the fluid. I next fill a goblet with water up to
the brim, and cover it with a sheet of paper which touches both the edge of the
glass and the surface of the water. I turn the glass upside down, and the sheet
of paper prevents the water running out, because it is held in place by atmospheric
pressure (fig. 41). It sometimes happens that this experiment does not
succeed till after a few attempts on the part of the operator; thus it is prudent
to turn the glass over a basin, so that, in case of failure, the water is not
spilt. Having obtained a vase and a bottle, both quite full of water, take the
bottle, holding it round the neck so that the thumb can be used as a stopper,
then turn it upside down, and pass the neck into the water in the vase.
Remove your thumb, or stopper, keeping the bottle in a vertical position,
and you will see that the water it contains does not escape, but remains in
suspension. It is atmospheric pressure which produces this phenomenon. If,
instead of water, we put milk in the bottle, or some other fluid denser than
water, we shall see that the milk also remains suspended in the bottle, only
there is a movement of the fluid in the neck of the bottle, and on careful
examination we perceive very plainly that the milk descends to the bottom
of the vase, and the water rises into the bottle. Here, again, it is atmo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>spheric
pressure which maintains the fluid in the bottle, but the milk
descends, because fluids are superposed according to their order of density,
and the densest liquid falls to the bottom.</p>

<p>This can be verified by means of the <em>phial of the four elements</em>, which is
a plain, long, and narrow bottle, containing equal volumes of metallic mercury,
salt water, alcohol, and oil. These four liquids will lie one on the top of the
other without ever mixing, even if shaken.</p>

<p>Another experiment as to the pressure of the air may be made (fig. 42).
Take a penny and press it against some oaken bookcase or press, rub the coin
against the wood for a few seconds, then press it, and withdraw the fingers.
The coin will continue to adhere to the wood. The reason of this is, because
by the rubbing and the pressure you have dispersed the film of air which was
between the penny and the wood, and under those conditions the pressure of
the atmospheric air was sufficient to keep the penny in its place.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_047.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 41.—Pressure of the air.</div>
</div>

<p>Or, again, let us now add a water-bottle and a hard-boiled egg to our
appliances; we will make use of the air-pump, and easily perform another
experiment. I light a piece of paper, and let it burn, plunging it into
a water-bottle full of air. When the paper has been burning a few seconds
I close the opening of the water-bottle by means of a hard-boiled egg, which
I have previously divested of its shell, so that it forms a hermetic stopper.
The burning of the paper has now caused a vacuum of air in the bottle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the egg is gradually thrust in by the atmospheric pressure outside. Fig. 43
exhibits it slowly lengthening and stretching out as it passes through the
aperture; then it is suddenly thrust completely into the bottle with a little
explosive sound, like that produced by striking a paper bag expanded with
air. This is atmospheric pressure demonstrated in the clearest manner, and
at little cost.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_048.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 42.—Coin adhering by pressure of air.</div>
</div>

<p>If it is desired to pursue a little further the experiments relating to
atmospheric pressure, it will be easy enough to add to the before-mentioned
appliances a closed glass-tube and some mercury, and one will then have
the necessary elements for performing Torricelli’s and Pascal’s experiments,
and explaining the theory of the barometer (page 52).</p>

<p>An amusing toy, well-known to schoolboys, called the “sucker,” may
also be made the object of many dissertations on the vacuum and the
pressure of air. It is composed of a round piece of soft leather, to the centre
of which is attached a small cord. This leather is placed on the ground and
pressed under foot, and when the cord is pulled it forms a cupping-glass, and
is only separated with difficulty from the pavement.</p>

<p>Atmospheric air, in common with other gases, has a tendency to fill any
space into which it may enter. The mutual attraction of particles of air is
<em>nil</em>; on the contrary, they appear to have a tendency to fly away from each
other; this property is called “repulsion.” Air also possesses an expansive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
property—a tendency to press against all the sides of any vessel in which
it may be enclosed. Of course the larger the vessel containing a given
quantity of air, the less actual pressure it will exert on the sides of the vessel.
The elasticity of air therefore decreases with increasing expansion, but it
gains in elasticity or force when compressed.</p>

<p>There is a law in Physics which expresses the relation between expansion
and elasticity of gases, which may be said to be as follows:—</p>

<p>The elasticity (of a gas) is in inverse ratio to the space it occupies, and
therefore by compressing air into a small space we can obtain a great force,
as in the air-gun and the pop-gun of our youthful days.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 43.—Hard boiled egg, divested of its shell, passing through the neck of a  glass bottle, under the influence of
atmospheric pressure.</div></div>


<p>In the cut below we can illustrate the principle of the pop-gun. The
chamber full of air is closed by a cork and by an air-tight piston (<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>) at <i>p</i> and <i>p</i>.
When the piston is pushed into the chamber the air is compressed between
it and the stopper, which at length flies out forcibly with a loud report</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 44.—The principle of the pop-gun.</div>
</div>

<p>We have said that the tendency of air particles is to fly away from each
other, and were it not for the earth’s attraction the air might be dispersed.
The height of the atmosphere has been variously estimated from a height of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
45 miles to 212 miles in an attenuated form; but perhaps 100 miles high
would be a fair estimate of the height to which our atmosphere extends.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_050.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 45.—Weighing the air.</div>
</div>

<p>The pressure of such an enormous body of gas is very great. It has
been estimated that this pressure on the average human body amounts to
fourteen tons, but being balanced by elastic fluids in the body, the inconvenience
is not felt. The <em>Weight</em> of Air can easily be ascertained, though
till the middle of the seventeenth century the air was believed to be without
weight. The accompanying illustration will prove the weight of air. Take
an ordinary balance; and suspend to one side a glass globe fitted with a
stop-cock. From this globe extract the air by means of the air-pump, and
weigh it. When the exact weight is ascertained turn the stop-cock, the
air will rush in, and the globe will then pull down the balance, thus proving
that air possesses weight. The experiments of Torricelli and Otto von
Guerike, however, demonstrated that the air has weight and great pressure.
Torricelli practically invented the barometer, but Otto von Guerike, by the
cups known as <em>Magdeburg Hemispheres</em>, proved the pressure of the outward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
air. This apparatus is well known, and consists of two hollow copper hemispheres
which fit very closely. By means of the air-pump which he invented
in 1650, Otto von Guerike exhausted the air from
the closed hemispheres. So long as air remained in
them, there was no great difficulty in separating them;
but when it had been finally exhausted, the pressure
of the surrounding atmosphere was so great that the
hollow spheres could not be dragged asunder even
by horses harnessed to rings which had been inserted
in the globes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_051a.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 46.—Magdeburg Hemispheres.</div>
</div>

<p>The <em>Air-Pump</em> is a very useful machine, and we
will now briefly explain its action. The inventor was,
as remarked above, Otto von Guerike, of Magdeburg.
The pump consists of a cylinder and piston and
rod, with two valves opening upwards—one valve
being in the bottom of the cylinder, the other in the
piston. This pump is attached by a tube to a plate with a hole in it,
one extremity of the tube being fixed in the centre of the plate, and
the other at the valve at the bottom of the cylinder. A glass shade, called
the <em>receiver</em>, is placed on the top of the plate, and of course this shade will be
full of air (fig. 47).</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_051b.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 47.—The air-pump.</div>
</div>

<p>When the receiver is in position, we begin to work the pump. We
have said there are two valves. So when the piston is
drawn up, the cylinder would be quite empty did not the
valve at the bottom, opening upwards, admit some air
from the glass shade through the tube to enter the cylinder.
Now the lower part of the cylinder is full of air
drawn from the glass shade. When we press the piston
down again, we press against the air in it, which, being
compressed, tries to escape. It cannot go back, because
the valve at the bottom of the cylinder won’t open, so it escapes by the
valve in the piston, and goes away. Thus a certain amount of air is got
rid of at each stroke of the piston. Two cylinders and pistons can be
used, and so by means of cog-wheels, etc., the air may be rapidly exhausted
from the receiver. Many experiments are made with the assistance of the air-pump
and receiver, though the air is never <em>entirely</em> exhausted from the glass.</p>

<p>The “Sprengel” air-pump is used to create an almost perfect vacuum,
by putting a vessel to be exhausted in connection with the vacuum at the
top of a tube of mercury thirty inches high. Some air will bubble out, and
the mercury will fall. By filling up again and repeating the process, the air
vessel will in time be completely exhausted. This is done by Mr. Sprengel’s
pump, and a practically perfect vacuum is obtained, like the <em>Torricellian</em> vacuum.</p>

<p>The “Torricellian vacuum” is the empty space above the column of
mercury in the barometer which we will proceed to describe. Air has a
certain weight or pressure which is sufficient to raise a column of mercury thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
inches. We will prove this by illustration. Take a bent tube and fill it with
mercury; the liquid will stand equally high in both arms, in consequence
of the ratio of equilibrium in fluids, of which we shall read more when we come
to consider Water. So the two columns of mercury
are in equilibrium. (See <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>.) Now stop the arm a
with a cork, and take out half the mercury. It will
remain in one arm only. Remove the cork, and the
fluid will fall in both arms, and remain in equilibrio.
If a long bent glass tube be used, the arms being
thirty-six inches high, the mercury will fall to a
point <i>c</i>, which measures 29·9 inches from the bottom.
If the tube be a square inch in bore, we
have 29·9 cubic inches of mercury, weighing 14⅘ lbs., balancing a column
of air one square inch thick and as high as the atmosphere. So the mercury
and the column of air must weigh the same. Thus every square inch on
the earth supports a weight of (nearly) 15 lbs (figs. 48 and 50).</p>

<div class="figleft" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 48.—Air Pressure.</div>
</div>

<p>The barometer invented by Pascal, working on the investigations of
Torricelli, is a very simple and useful instrument. Fill a tube with mercury
from which all moisture has been expelled, and turn it over in a dish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
of mercury; the mercury will rise to a certain height (30 inches), and no
higher in vacuo. When the pressure of the air increases the mercury rises
a little, and falls when the pressure is removed. Air charged
with aqueous vapour is lighter than dry air, so a fall in the
mercury indicates a certain amount of water-vapour in the air,
which may condense and become rain. The action of mercury
is therefore used as a weather-glass, by which an index-point
shows the movements of the fluid, by means of a wheel over
which a thread passes, sustaining a float and a counterpoise.
When the mercury rises the float goes up, and the weight falls,
and turns the wheel by means of the thread. The wheel having
a pointer on the dial tells us how the mercury moves. This
<em>weather-glass</em> is the usual <em>syphon barometer</em> with the float on the
surface and a weight (fig. 50).</p>

<p>The Syphon Barometer is a bent
tube like the one already shown, with
one limb much shorter than the other.</p>

<p>The Aneroid Barometer, so called
because it is “without moisture,” is now
in common use. In these instruments
the atmospheric pressure is held in
equilibrium by an elastic metal spring
or tube. A metal box, or tube, is freed
from air, and then hermetically sealed.
This box has a flexible side, the elasticity
of which, and the pressure of the
air on it, keep each other in equilibrium.
Upon this elastic side the
short arm of a lever is pressed, while
the longer arm works an index-point,
as in the circular barometer. When
pressure increases the elastic box “gives”;
when pressure diminishes it returns to
its former place, and the index moves in
the opposite direction. It is necessary
to compare and “set” the aneroid with
the mercurial barometer to ensure correctness.
A curved tube is sometimes
used, which coils and uncoils like a spring,
according to the pressure on it.</p>

<p>There are other barometers, such as
the Water Barometer, which can be fixed
against the side of a house, and if the
water be coloured, it will prove a useful
indicator. As the name indicates, water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
is used instead of mercury, but as the latter is thirteen-and-half times
heavier than water, a much longer tube is necessary; viz., one about thirty-five
feet in length. The construction is easy enough. A leaden pipe can
be fixed against the house; on the top is a funnel furnished with a stop-cock,
and placed in a vase of water. The lower part of the tube is bent,
and a glass cylinder attached, with another stop-cock—the glass being about
three feet long, and graduated. Fill the tube with water, shut the upper
stop-cock, and open the lower one. The vacuum will be formed in the top
of the tube, and the barometer will act on a larger scale than the mercury.</p>

<p>The Glycerine Barometer, invented by Mr. Jordan, and in use at the
<cite>Times</cite> office, registers as more than one inch movements which on the mercurial
thermometer are only one-tenth of an inch, and so are very distinctly
visible. The specific gravity of pure glycerine is less than one-tenth that of
mercury, so the mean height of the glycerine column is twenty-seven feet at
sea level. The glycerine has, however, a tendency to absorb moisture from
the air, but Mr. Jordan, by putting some petroleum oil upon the glycerine,
neutralized that tendency, and the atmospheric pressure remains the same.
A full description of this instrument was given in the <cite>Times</cite> of 25th October,
1880.</p>

</div>

<p>The uses of the barometer are various. It is employed to calculate the
heights of mountains; for if a barometer at sea level stand at 30", it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
be lower on a mountain top, because the amount of air at an elevation
of ten thousand feet is less than at the level of the sea, and consequently
exercises less pressure, and the mercury descends. [The pressure is on
the bulb of mercury at the bottom, not on the <em>top</em>, remember.]</p>

<p>The pressure of the air at the tops of mountains sometimes decreases
very much, and it is not sufficiently dense for perfect respiration, as many
people find. Some climbers suffer from bleeding at the nose, etc., at great
altitudes. This is occasioned by the action of the heart, which pumps with
great force, and the outward pressure upon the little veins being so much less
than usual, they give way.</p>

</div>
<p>Many important instruments depend upon atmospheric pressure. The
most important of these is the pump, which will carry us to the consideration
of water and <span class="smcap">Fluids</span> generally. The fire-engine is another example,
but we will now proceed to explain the diving-bell already referred to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. 52 represents the experiment of the diving-bell, which is so simple,
and is explained below. It belongs to the same category of experiments
as those relating to the pressure of air and compression of gas. Two or
three flies have been introduced into the glass, and they prove by their
buzzing about that they are quite at their ease in the rather confined space.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Diving-Bell</span> in a crude form appears to have been used as early
as 1538. It was used by two Greeks in the presence of the Emperor
Charles V., and numerous spectators. In the year 1720 Doctor Halley
improved the diving-bell, which was a wooden box or chamber open at the
bottom. Air casks were used to keep the inmate supplied with air. The
modern diving-bell was used by Smeaton in 1788, and was made of cast
iron. It sinks by its own weight. The pressure of the air inside is sufficient
to keep the water out. Air being easily compressed, it is always
pumped in to keep the hollow iron “bell” full, and to supply the workmen.
There are inventions now in use by which the diver carries a supply of air
with him on his back, and by turning a tap can supply himself for a long
time at a distance from the place of descent, and thus is able to dispense
with the air-tube from the boat at the surface. This apparatus was exhibited
at the Crystal Palace some years ago.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 54.—The Hand Fire-Engine</div>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Pump</span>.</p>

<p>We have seen in the case of the Water Barometer that the pressure
of the air will sustain a column of water about thirty feet high. So the
distance between the lower valve and the reservoir or cistern must not be
more than thirty-two feet, practically the distance is about twenty-five feet
in pumps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>We can see by the illustration that the working is much the same as in
the air-pump. The suction pipe <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> is closed by the valve <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, the cylinder <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>
and spout <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> are above, the piston rod <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span> lifts the air-tight piston in which is
a valve <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>. When the piston is raised the valve <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> opens and admits the
water into the cylinder. When the piston is depressed the valve <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> is closed,
the water already in forces <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span> open, and passing through the piston, reaches
the cylinder and the spout (fig. 55).</p>

<p>The hand fire-engine depends upon the action of compressed air, which
is so compressed by pumping water into the air chamber <i>a</i>. The tube is
closed at <i>g</i>, and the pumps <i>e e</i> drive water into the air chamber. At length
the tap is opened, and the air drives the water out as it is continually
supplied (fig. 54).</p>

<p>Compressed air was also used for driving the boring
machines in the Mount Cenis tunnel. In this case also
the air was compressed by water, and then let loose, like
steam, to drive a machine furnished with boring
instruments.</p>

<p>A pretty little toy may be made, and at the same
time exemplify an interesting fact in Physics. It is
called the <i>ludion</i>, and it “lies in a nut shell” in every
sense. When the kernel has been extracted from the
shell, fasten the portions together with sealing wax, so
that no water can enter. At one end <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>, as in the illustration,
leave a small hole about as large as a pin’s head;
fasten two threads to the sealing wax, and  to the threads
a wooden doll. Let a weight be attached to his waist.
When the figure is in equilibrium, and will float, put it
into a jar of water, and tie a piece of bladder over the
top. If this covering be pressed with the finger, the doll
will descend and remount when the finger is removed.
By quick successive pressure the figure may be made
to execute a <i lang="fr">pas seul</i>. The reason of the movement
is because the slight cushion of air in the upper part of
the vase is compressed, and the little water thus caused to enter the nut
shell makes it heavier, and it descends with the figure (fig. 56).</p>

<p>We have now seen that air is a gas, that it exercises pressure, that it
possesses weight. We know it can be applied to many useful purposes, and
that the air machines and inventions—such as the air-pump and the “Pneumatic
Despatch”—are in daily use in our laboratories, our steam engines, our condensed
milk manufactories, and in many other industries, and for our social
benefit. Compressed air is a powerful motor for boring machinery in tunnels
where steam cannot be used, even if water could be supplied, for smoke or
fire would suffocate the workers. To air we owe our life and our happiness
on earth.</p>

<p>Pneumatics, then, deals with the mechanical properties of elastic fluids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
represented by air. A gas is an elastic fluid, and differs very considerably,
from water; for a gas will fill a large or small space with equal convenience,
like the genii which came out of the bottle and obligingly retired into it again
to please the fisherman. We have seen that the pressure of the air is 14⅘
per square inch at a temperature of 32°. It is not so easy to determine the
pressure of air at various times as that of water. We can always tell the
pressure of a column of water when we find the height of the column, as it is
the weight of so many cubic inches of the liquid. But the pressure of the
atmosphere per square inch at any point is equal to the weight of a vertical
column of air one inch square, reaching from that point to the limit of the
atmosphere above it. Still the density is not the same at all points, so we
have to calculate. The average pressure at sea level is 14·7 per square
inch, and sustains a column of mercury 1 square inch in thickness, 29·92, or
say 30 inches high. These are the data upon which the barometer is based,
as we have seen.</p>

<p class="hang">ABOUT WATER—HYDROSTATICS AND HYDRAULICS—LAW OF ARCHIMEDES—THE
BRAMAH PRESS—THE SYPHON.</p>


<p>At present we will pass from Air to Water, from Pneumatics to Hydrostatics
and Hydraulics. We must remember that Hydrostatics and Hydraulics are
very different. The former treats of the weight and pressure of liquids when
they are at rest, the latter treats of them in motion. We will now speak of the
properties of Liquids, of which Water may be taken as the most familiar
example.</p>

<p>We have already seen that Matter exists in the form of Solids, Liquids,
and Gases, and of course Water is one form of Matter. It occupies a certain
space, is slightly compressible; it possesses weight, and exercises force when
in motion. It is a fluid, but also a liquid. There are fluids not liquid, such
as air or steam, to take equally familiar examples. These are elastic fluids
and compressible, while water is inelastic, and termed incompressible.</p>

<p>The chemical composition of water will be considered hereafter, but at
present we may state that water is composed of oxygen and hydrogen, and
proportions of eight of the former to one of the latter by weight; in volume
the hydrogen is as two to one.</p>

<p>From these facts, as regards water, we learn that volume and weight are
very different things,—that equal volumes of various things may have
different weights, and that volume (or bulk) by no means indicates weight
Equal volumes of feathers and sand will weigh very differently.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[The old “catch” question of the “difference in weight between a pound of lead and a
pound of feathers” here comes to the mind. The answer generally given is that “feathers
make the heavier ‘pound’ because they are weighed by avoirdupois, and lead by troy weight.”
This is an error. They are both weighed in the same way, and pound for pound are the same
<em>weight</em>, though different in <em>volume</em>.]</p></blockquote>

<p>Fluids in equilibrium have all their particles at the same distance from
the centre of the earth, and although within small distances liquids appear
perfectly level (in a direct line), they must, as the sea does, conform to the
shape of the earth, though in small levels the space is too limited to admit of
any deviation from the plane at right angle to the direction of gravity.</p>

<p>Liquids always fall to a perfectly level surface, and water will seek to
find its original level, whether it be in one side of a bent tube, in a watering
pot and its spout, or as a fountain. The surface of the water will be on the
same level in the arms of a bent tube, and the fountain will rise to a height<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
corresponding with the elevation of the parent spring whence it issues. The
waterworks companies first pump the water to a high reservoir, and then it
rises equally high in our high-level cisterns.</p>

<p>As an example of the force of water, a pretty little experiment may be
easily tried, and, as many of our readers have seen in a shop in the Strand
in London, it always is attractive. A good-sized glass shade should be
procured and placed over a water tap and basin, as per the illustration herewith.
Within the glass put a number of balls of cork or other light material.
Let a stop-cock, with a small aperture, be fixed upon the tube leading into
the glass. Another tube to carry away the water should, of course, be
provided, but it may be used over again. When the tap is properly fixed, if
the pressure of the water be sufficient, it will rush out with some force, and
catching the balls as they fall to the bottom of the glass shade bear them up
as a juggler would throw oranges from hand to hand. If coloured balls be
used the effect may be enhanced, and much variety imparted to the experiment,
which is very easy to make.</p>

<p>Water exercises an enormous pressure, but the pressure does not depend
upon the amount of water in the vessel. It depends upon the vessel’s height,
and the dimensions of the base. This has been proved by filling vessels
whose bases and heights are equal, but whose shapes are different, each
holding a different quantity of water. The pressure at the bottom of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
vessel is the same, and depends upon the depth of the water. If we subject
a portion of the liquid surface to certain force, this pressure will be
dispersed equally in all directions, and from an acquaintance with this fact
the Hydraulic Press was brought into notice. If a vessel with a horizontal
bottom be filled with water to a depth of one foot, every square foot will
sustain a pressure of 62·37 lbs., and each square inch of 0·433 lbs.</p>

<div class="caption"> Figs. 58, 59, 60, 61.—Pressure of Water.</div>
</div>

<p>We will now explain the principle of this <span class="smcap">Water
Press</span>. In the small diagram, the letters <span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span> represent
the bottom of a cylinder which has a piston fitted in it
(<span class="smcap lowercase">P</span>). Into the opposite side a pipe is let in, which leads
from a force-pump <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>, which is fitted with a valve <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>,
opening upwards. When the piston in <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span> is pulled up
water enters through the valve; when the piston is
forced down the valve shuts, and the water rushes into
the chamber <span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span>. The pressure pushes up the large piston with a force
multiplied as many times as the area of the small piston is contained in the
large one. So if the large one be ten
times as great as the small one, and the
latter be forced down with a 10 lb.
pressure, the pressure on the large one
will be 100 lbs., and so on.</p>

<p>The principles of hydrostatics will
be easily explained. The Lectures of
M. Aimé Schuster, Professor and Librarian
at Metz, have taught us in a very
simple manner the principle of Archimedes,
in which it is laid down that “a
body immersed in a liquid loses a portion
of its weight equal to the weight
of the liquid displaced by it.” We take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
a body of as irregular form as we please; a stone, for example. A thread
is attached to the stone, and it is then placed in a glass of water full up to
the brim. The water overflows; a volume of the liquid equal to that of the
stone runs over. The glass thus partially emptied is then dried, and placed
on the scale of a balance, beneath which we suspend the stone; equilibrium
is established by placing some pieces of lead in the other scale. We then
take a vase full of water, into which we plunge the stone suspended from
the scale, supporting the vase by means of bricks. The equilibrium is now
broken; to re-establish it, it is necessary to fill up with water the glass
placed on the scale; that is to say, we put back in the glass the weight of a
volume of water precisely equal to that of the stone.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_062.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 64.—Demonstration of the upward pressure of liquids.</div>
</div>

<p>If it is desired to investigate the principles relating to connected vessels,
springs of water, artesian wells, etc., two funnels, connected by means of an
india-rubber tube of certain length, will serve for the demonstration; and by
placing the first funnel at a higher level, and pouring in water abundantly,
we shall see that it overflows from the second.</p>

<p>A disc of cardboard and a lamp-glass will be all that is required to
show the upward pressure of liquids. I apply to the opening of the lamp-glass
a round piece of cardboard, which I hold in place by means of a string;
the tube thus closed I plunge into a vessel filled with water. The piece of
cardboard is held by the pressure of the water upwards. To separate it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
from the opening it suffices to pour some water into the tube up to the level
of the water outside (fig. 64). The outer pressure exercised on the disc,
as well as the pressure beneath, is now equal to the weight of a body of
water having for its base the surface of the opening of the tube, its depth
being the distance from the cardboard to the level of the water.</p>

<p>Syringes, pumps, etc., are the effects of atmospheric pressure. Balloons
rise in the air by means of the pressure of gas; a balloon being a body
plunged in gas, is consequently submitted to the same laws as a body plunged
in water.</p>

<p>Boats float because of the pressure of liquid, and water spurts from a
fountain for the same reason. I recollect having read a very useful application
of the principles of fluid pressure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_063.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig 65.—Experiment on the convexity of a meniscus.</div>
</div>

<p>A horse was laden with two tubs for carrying a supply of water, and
in the bottom of the tubs a valve was fixed. When the horse entered the
stream the tubs were partly immersed; the water then exercised its upward
pressure, the valve opened, and the tubs slowly filled. When they were nearly
full the horse turned round and came out of the water; the pressure had
ceased.</p>

<p>Thus the action of the water first opened the valve, and then closed it.</p>

<p>The particular phenomena observable in the water level in narrow spaces,
as of a fine glass tube, or the level of two adjoining waves, capillary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
phenomena, etc., do not need any special appliance for demonstration, and it
is the same with the convexity or concavity of meniscuses.</p>

<p>Fig. 65 represents a pretty experiment in connection with these
phenomena. I take a glass, which I fill up to the brim, taking care that
the meniscus be concave, and near it I place a pile of pennies. I then ask
my young friends how many pennies can be thrown into the glass without
the water overflowing. Everyone who is not familiar with the experiment
will answer that it will only be possible to put in one or two, whereas it is
possible to put in a considerable number, even ten or twelve. As the
pennies are carefully and slowly dropped in, the surface of the liquid will
be seen to become more and more convex, and one
is surprised to what an extent this convexity
increases before the water overflows.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_064.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 66.—The Syphon.</div>
</div>

<p>The common <em>syphon</em> may be mentioned here. It
consists of a bent tube with limbs of unequal length.
We give an illustration of the syphon (fig. 66). The
shorter leg being put into the mixture, the air is exhausted
from the tube at <i>o</i>, the aperture at <i>g</i> being
closed with the finger. When the finger is removed
the liquid will run out. If the water were equally
high in both legs the pressure of the atmosphere would
hold the fluid in equilibrium, but one leg being
longer, the column of water in it preponderates, and as it falls, the pressure
on the water in the vessel keeps up the supply.</p>

<p>Apropos of the syphon, we may mention a very simple application of
the principle. Cut off a strip of cloth, and arrange it so that one end shall
remain in a glass of water while the other hangs down, as in the illustration.
In a short time the water from the upper glass will have passed through the
cloth-fibres to the lower one (fig. 67).</p>

<p>This attribute of porous substances is called <em>capillarity</em>, and shows itself
by <em>capillary attraction</em> in very fine pores or tubes. The same phenomenon is
exhibited in blotting paper, sugar, wood, sand, and lamp-wicks, all of which
give familiar instances of capillarity. The cook makes use of this property
by using thin paper to absorb grease from the surface of soups.</p>

<p>Capillarity (referred to on page 25) is the term used to define
capillary force, and is derived from the word <i lang="la">capillus</i>, a hair; and so very
small bore tubes are called capillary tubes. We know that when we
plunge a glass tube into water the liquid will rise up in it, and the narrower the
tube the higher the water will go; moreover, the water inside will be higher
than at the outside. This is in accordance with a well-known law of adhesion,
which induces concave or convex surfaces<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> in the liquids in the tubes, according
as the tube is wetted with the liquid or not. For instance, water, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
have said, will be higher in the tube, and concave in form; but mercury will
be depressed below the outside level, and convex, because mercury will not
adhere to glass. When the force of cohesion to the sides of the tube is more
than twice as great as the adhesion of the particles of the liquid, it will rise
up the sides, and if the forces be reversed, the rounded appearance will follow.
This accounts for the convex appearance, or “meniscus,” in the column of
mercury in a barometer.</p>

<p>Amongst the complicated experiments to demonstrate molecular attraction,
the following is very simple and very pretty:—Take two small balls of
cork, and having placed them in a basin half-filled with water, let them come
close to each other. When they have approached within a certain distance
they will rush together. If you fix one of them on the blade of your penknife,
it will attract the other as a magnet, so that you can lead it round
the basin (fig. 68). But if the balls of cork are covered with grease they will
<em>repel</em> each other, which fact is accounted for by the form of the <em>menisques</em>,
which are convex or concave, according as they are moistened, or preserved
from action of the water by the grease.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 67.—An improvised syphon.</div>
</div>

<p>This attribute is of great use in the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
The rising of the sap is one instance of the latter.</p>

<p>Experience in hydrostatics can be easily applied to amusing little
experiments. For instance, as regards the syphon, we may make an image<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
of <i>Tantalus</i> as per illustration (fig. 69). A wooden figure may be cut in a
stooping posture, and placed in the centre of a wide vase, as if about to drink.
If water be poured slowly into the vase it will never rise to the mouth of
the figure, and the unhappy <i>Tantalus</i> will remain in expectancy. This
result is obtained by the aid of a syphon hidden in the figure, the shorter
limb of which is in the chest. The longer limb descends through a hole in
the table, and carries off the water. These vases are called <em>vases of Tantalus</em>.</p>

<p>The principle of the syphon may also be adapted to our domestic
filters. Charcoal, as we know, makes an excellent filter, and if we have a
block of charcoal in one of those filters,—now so common,—we can fix a tube
into it, and clear any water we may require. It sometimes (in the country)
happens that drinking-water may become turgid, and in such a case the
syphon filter will be found useful.</p>

<p>The old “deception” jugs have often puzzled people. We give an illustration
of one, and also a sketch of the “deceptive” portion (figs. 70 and 71).
This deception is very well managed, and will create much amusement if a jug
can be procured; they were fashionable in the eighteenth century, and previously.
A cursory inspection of these curious utensils will lead one to vote
them utterly useless. They are, however, very quaint, and if not exactly
useful are ornamental. They are so constructed, that if an inexperienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
person wish to pour out the wine or water contained in them, the liquid will
run out through the holes cut in the jug.</p>

<p>To use them with safety it is necessary to put the spout <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> in one’s
mouth, and close the opening <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> with the finger, and then by drawing in the
breath, cause the water to mount to the lips by the tube which runs around
the jug. The specimens herein delineated have been copied from some now
existent in the museum of the Sèvres china manufactory.</p>

<p>The <em>Buoyancy of Water</em> is a very interesting subject, and a great deal
may be written respecting it. The swimmer will tell us that it is easier to
float in salt water than in fresh. He knows by experience <em>how difficult it is
to sink</em> in the sea; and yet hundreds of people are drowned in the water,
which, if they permitted it to exercise its power of buoyancy, would help to
save life.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 69.—Vase of Tantalus.</div>
</div>

<p>The sea-water holds a considerable quantity of salt in solution, and this
adds to its resistance, or floating power. It is heavier than fresh water, and
the Dead Sea is so salt that a man cannot possibly sink in it. This means
that the man’s body, bulk for bulk, is much lighter than the water of the
Dead Sea. A man will sink in fresh, or ordinary salt water if the air in his
lungs be exhausted, because without the air he is much heavier than water,
bulk for bulk. So if anything is weighed in water, it apparently loses in
weight exactly equal to its own bulk of water.</p>

<p>Water is the means by which the <em>Specific Gravity</em> of liquids or solids is
found, and by it we can determine the relative densities of matter in proportion.
Air is the standard for gases and vapours. Let us examine this, and
see what is meant by <span class="smcap">Specific Gravity</span>.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the difference existing between two equal
volumes of different substances, and their weight, which proves that they
may contain a different number of atoms in the same space. We also know,
from the principle of Archimedes, that <em>if a body be immersed in a fluid, a
portion of its weight will be sustained by the fluid equal to the weight of the
fluid displaced</em>.</p>

<p>[This theorem is easily proved by filling a bucket with water, and moving
it about in water, when it will be easy to lift; and likewise the human body
may be easily sustained in water by a finger under the chin.]</p>

</div>

<p>The manner in which Archimedes discovered the displacement of liquids
is well known, but is always interesting. King Hiero, of Syracuse, ordered
a crown of gold to be made, and when it had been completed and delivered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
to His Majesty, he had his doubts about the honesty of the goldsmith, and
called to Archimedes to tell him whether or not the crown was of gold, pure
and simple. Archimedes was puzzled, and
went home deep in thought. Still considering
the problem he went to the bath,
and in his abstraction filled it to the brim.
Stepping in he spilt a considerable quantity
of water, and at once the idea struck him
that any body put into water would displace
its own weight of the liquid. He did not
wait to dress, but ran half-naked to the
palace, crying out, “Eureka, Eureka! I
have found it, I have found it! “What
had he found?—He had solved the problem.</p>



<p>He got a lump of gold the same weight
as the crown, and immersed it in water. He
found it weighed nineteen times as much as
its own bulk of water. But when he weighed
the kings crown he found it displaced more water than the pure gold had
done, and consequently it had been adulterated by a lighter metal. He
assumed that the alloy was silver, and by immersing lumps of
silver and gold of equal weight with the crown, and weighing
the water that overflowed from each dip, he was able to tell the
king how far he had been cheated by the goldsmith.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_069b.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 72.—Weighing metal in water.</div>
</div>

<p>It is by this method now that we can ascertain the specific gravity
of bodies. One cubic inch of water weighs about half an ounce (or to be
exact, 252&frac12; grains). Take a piece of lead and weigh it in air;
it weighs, say, eleven ounces. Then weigh it in a vase of water, and it
will be only ten ounces in weight. So lead is eleven times heavier than
water, or eleven ounces of lead occupy the same space as one ounce of
water.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_069c.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 73.—Hydrometer.</div>
</div>

<p>[The heavier a fluid is, or the greater its density, the greater
will be the weight it will support. Therefore we can ascertain
the purity or otherwise of certain liquids by using hydrometers,
etc., which will float higher or lower in different liquids, and
being gauged at the standard of purity, we can ascertain (for
instance) how much water is in the milk when supplied from the dairy.]</p>

<p>But to return to <span class="smcap">Specific Gravity</span>, which means the “Comparative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
density of any substance relatively to water,” or as Professor Huxley says,
“The weight of a volume of any liquid or solid in proportion to the weight
of the same volume of water, at a known temperature and pressure.”</p>

<p>Water, therefore, is taken as the unit; so anything whose equal volume
under the same circumstances is twice as heavy as the water, is declared
to have its specific gravity 2; if three-and-a-half times it is 3·5, and so on.
We append a few examples; so we see that things which possess a higher
specific gravity than water sink, which comes to the same thing as saying
they are heavier than water, and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>To find the specific gravity of any solid body proceed as above, in
the experiment of the lead. By weighing the substance in and out of water
we find the weight of the water displaced; that is, the first weight less the
second. Divide the weight in air by the remainder, and we shall find the
specific gravity of the substance.</p>

<p>But we have by no means exhausted the uses of water. Hydrodynamics,
which is the alternative term for hydraulics, includes the consideration
of many forms of water-wheels, most of which, as mill-wheels, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
under-shot, or over-shot accordingly as the water passes horizontally over
the floats, or acts beneath them. These wheels are used in relation to the
fall of water. If there is plenty of water and a slight fall, the under-shot
wheel is used. If there is a good fall less water will suffice, as the weight
and momentum of the falling liquid upon the paddles will turn the wheel.
Here is the Persian water-wheel, used for irrigation (fig. 75). The Archimedian
Screw, called after its inventor, was one of the earliest modes of raising
water. It consists of a cylinder somewhat inclined, and a tube bent like a
screw within it. By turning the handle of the screw the water is drawn up
and flows out from the top.</p>

Domestic Economy, in accordance with our plan, will also lead us up to
some of the uses of water. So for the present we will take our leave of
water in a liquid form, and meet it again under the application of Heat,
which subject will take us to Ice and Steam,—two very different conditions
of water.</p>

<p class="hang">HEAT—WHAT IT IS—THEORY OF HEAT—THE THERMOMETER—EXPANSION
BY HEAT—EBULLITION AND DISTILLATION—LATENT HEAT—SPECIFIC
HEAT.</p>


<p>What is Heat?—We will consider this question, and endeavour to
explain it before we speak of its effects on water and other matter.</p>

<p>Heat is now believed to be the effects of the rapid motion of all the
particles of a body. It is quite certain that a heated body is no heavier
than the same body before it was made “hot,” so the heat could not have
gone into it, nor does the “heat” leave it when it has become what we call
“cold,” which is a relative term. Heat is therefore believed to be a
vibratory motion, or the effects of very rapid motion of matter.</p>

<p>The Science of Heat, as we may term it, is only in its infancy, or
certainly has scarcely come of age. Formerly heat was considered a
chemical agent, and was termed caloric, but now heat is found to be
motion, which affects our nerves of feeling and sight; and, as Professor
Stewart tells us, “a heated body gives a series of blows to the medium
around it; and although these blows do not affect the ear, they affect the
eye, and give us a sense of light.”</p>

<p>Although it is only within a comparatively few years that heat has
been really looked upon as other than matter, many ancient philosophers
regarded it as merely a <em>quality</em> of matter. They thought it the active
principle of the universe. Epicurus declared that heat was an effluxion of
minute spherical particles possessing rapid motion, and Lucretius maintained
that the sun’s light and heat are the result of motion of primary particles.
Fire was worshipped as the active agent of the universe, and Prometheus
was fabled to have stolen fire from heaven to vivify mankind. The views
of the ancients were more or less adopted in the Middle Ages; but John
Locke recognized the theory of heat being a motion of matter. He says:
“What in our sensation is <em>heat</em>, in the object is nothing but <em>motion</em>.”</p>

<p>Gradually two theories arose concerning heat;—one, the Material
theory—the theory of Caloric or Phlogiston; the other, the Kinetic theory.
Before the beginning of the present century the former theory was generally
accepted, and the development of heat was accounted for by asserting that
the friction or percussion altered the capacity for heat of the substances
acted upon. The heat was squeezed out by the hammer, and the amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
of heat in the world was regarded as a certain quantity, which passed
from one body to another, and that some substances contained, or could
“store away,” more of the material called heat than other substances. Heat
was the material of fire—the principle of it, or <i lang="la">materia ignis</i>; and by these
theories Heat, or Caloric, was gradually adopted as a separate material agent—an
invisible and subtle matter producing certain phenomena when liberated.</p>

<p>So the two theories concerning heat arose at the end of the last century.
One, as we have said, is known as the Material, the other as the Kinetic
theory. The latter is the theory of motion, so called from the Greek <i lang="el">kinesis</i>
(motion), or sometimes known as the Dynamic theory of heat, from <i lang="el">dunamis</i>
(force); or again as Thermo-dynamics.</p>

<p>But any possibility of producing a new supply of heat was denied by the
materialists. They knew that some bodies possessed a greater capacity for
heat than others; but Count Rumford, at Munich, in 1797, astonished an
audience by making water boil without any fire! He had observed the
great extent to which a cannon became heated while being bored in the
gun factory, and influenced by those who maintained the material theory
of heat, paid great attention to the evolution of heat. He accordingly
endeavoured to produce heat by friction, and by means of horse power he
caused a steel borer to work upon a cylinder of metal. The shavings
were permitted to drop into a pan of water at 60° Fahrenheit. In an hour
after the commencement of the operation the temperature of the water
had risen to 107°: in another half-hour the heat of it was up to 142°:
and in two hours had measured 170°. Upon this he says: “It is hardly
necessary to add that anything which any insulated body or system of
bodies can continue to furnish without limitation cannot possibly be a
material substance, and it appears to me to be extremely difficult, if not
quite impossible, to form any distinct idea of anything capable of being
excited and communicated in these experiments except by <em>motion</em>.”</p>

<p>A few years later Sir Humphrey Davy made his conclusive experiments,
and the Material theory of heat received its death-blow.</p>

<p>Sir Humphrey Davy—referring to the fact that water at a freezing
temperature has “more heat in it” (as it was believed) than ice at the same
temperature—said: “If I, by friction, liquify ice, a substance will be
produced which contains a far greater absolute amount of heat than ice.
In this case it cannot reasonably be affirmed that I merely render <em>sensible</em>
heat which had been previously <em>insensible</em> in the frozen mass. Liquification
will conclusively prove the <em>generation</em> of heat.</p>

<p>This reasoning could not be doubted. Sir Humphrey Davy made the
experiment. He rubbed together two pieces of ice in the air, and in
a vacuum surrounded by a freezing mixture. The ice became liquified,
and so the generation of heat by “mechanical means” was proved. Its
immateriality was demonstrated, but the Material theory was not even then
abandoned by its adherents.</p>

<p>So things continued, until in 1842-3, Doctor Julius Meyer, of Heilbronn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
and Doctor Joule, of Manchester, separately, and by different means, arrived
at the conclusion that a certain definite amount of mechanical work corresponds
to a certain definite amount of Heat, and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>. Thus was a
great support afforded to the Dynamic theory. This fact Doctor Joule
communicated to the <cite>Philosophical Magazine</cite> in 1843, and the conclusions
he came to were—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. “That the quantity of heat produced by the friction of bodies, whether
solid or liquid, is always in proportion to the force expended;</p>

<p>2. “That the quantity of heat capable of increasing the temperature of
a pound of water (weighed <i lang="la">in vacuo</i> and taken at between 55° and
60° Fahr.) by 1° Fahr., requires for its evolution the expenditure
of a mechanical force represented by the fall of 772 lbs. through the
space of one foot.”</p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_074.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 76.—Melting a piece of tin on a card.</div>
</div>

<p>This is the “mechanical equivalent of heat.” The first paper written
by Mr. Joule demonstrated that the temperature of water rises when forced
through narrow tubes; and to heat it one degree, the force of 770 foot
pounds was necessary, which means that the 1 lb. of water falling 770 feet,
got hotter by one degree when it reached the earth. He subsequently
arrived at the more exact conclusions quoted above.</p>

<p>So heat is now known to be a series of vibrations, or vibratory motions,
as sound vibrations, which we cannot hear nor see, but the effects of which
are known to us as light and heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>In considering heat we must put aside the idea of warmth and cold, for
they are only different degrees of heat, not the absence of it.</p>

<p>The study of heat can be briefly undertaken without any complicated
apparatus. If we desire a proof of the great conducting power of metals,
let us place a fine piece of muslin tightly stretched over a lump of polished
metal. On the muslin we put a burning ember, and excite combustion by
blowing on it; the muslin is not burned in the least, the heat being entirely
absorbed by the metal, which draws it through the material into itself.
Fig. 76 represents a similar experiment: it consists of melting some tin on
a playing card, held over the flame of a spirit lamp. The metal becomes
completely melted without the card being burnt. It is through a similar
effect that metals appear cold to us when we take them in our hands; by
their conductibility they remove the heat from our hands, and give us the
peculiar impression which we do not experience when in contact with substances
that are bad conductors, such as wood, woollen materials, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_075.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 77.—Boiling water in a paper case.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 77 shows the method of boiling water in paper. We make a
small paper box, such as those made by school-boys, and suspend it by four
threads to a piece of wood held horizontally at a suitable height. We fill
this improvised vessel with water, and place it over the flame of a spirit
lamp. The paper is not burnt, because the water absorbs all the heat into
itself. After a few minutes the water begins to boil, sending forth clouds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of steam, but the paper remains intact. It is well to perform this operation
over a plate, in case of accident, as the water may be spilt. We may also
make use of an egg-shell as a little vessel in which to heat the water, by
resting it on a wire ring over the flame of the spirit lamp.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_076.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 78.—Experiment on the regelation of ice.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 78 shows the arrangement of a very remarkable experiment, but
little known, on the refreezing of ice. A block of ice is placed on the edge
of two iron chairs, and is encircled by a piece of wire, to which is suspended
the weight of say five pounds. The wire penetrates slowly, and in about an
hour’s time has passed completely through the lump of ice, and the weight,
with the piece of wire, falls to the ground. What happens then to the block
of ice?—You imagine, doubtless, that it is cut in two. No such thing; it is intact,
and in a single lump as it was previous to the experiment. In proportion
as the wire was sunk through the mass, the slit has been closed again by
refreezing. Ice or snow during the winter may serve for a number of experiments
relating to heat. If we wish to demonstrate the influence of colours
on radiation, we take two pieces of cloth of the same size,—one white, and
the other black,—and place them both on the snow, if possible, when there is
a gleam of sunlight. In a short time it will be found that the snow underneath
the black cloth has melted to a much greater extent than that
beneath the white cloth, because black absorbs heat more than white, which,
on the contrary, has a tendency to reflect it. We perceive very plainly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
difference in temperature by touching the two cloths. The white cloth feels
cold in comparison with the black cloth.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to point out experiments on the expansion of
bodies. They can be performed in a number of different ways; by placing
water in a narrow-necked bottle, and warming it over the fire, we can
ascertain the expansion of liquids under the influence of heat. We may in
this way construct a complete thermometer.</p>

<p>We may now consider the <em>Sources of Heat</em>, or causes of its development,
which are various, and in many cases apparent. The first great
source is the Sun, and it has been calculated that the heat received by
the earth in one year is sufficient to melt an envelope of ice surrounding
it one hundred and five feet thick. Of course the heat at the surface of
the sun is enormously greater than this, about one-half being absorbed in
the atmosphere before it reaches us at all. In fact, it is impossible to give
you an idea of the enormous heat given out by the sun to the earth (which
is a <em>very</em> small fraction indeed of the whole), stars, and planets, all of which
give out heat. We know that heat is stored in the earth, and that it is
in a very active condition we can perceive from the hot springs, lava, and
flame which are continually erupting from the earth in various places.
These sources of heat are beyond our control.</p>

<p>But apart from the extra- and intra-terrestrial sources of heat there
are mechanical causes for its generation upon our globe, such as friction,
percussion, or compression. The savage or the woodman can procure heat
and fire by rubbing a pointed stick in a grooved log. The wooden “breaks”
of a locomotive are often set on fire by friction of the wheels, so they
require grease, and the wheels on the rails will develop heat and sparks.
Our matches, and many other common instances of the generation of heat
(and fire) by friction, will occur to every reader. Water may be heated
by shaking it in a bottle, taking care to wrap something round it to keep
the warmth of the hand from the glass. By percussion, such as hammering
a nail or piece of iron, the solid bar may be made “red-hot”; and when
cannon are bored at Woolwich the shavings of steel are too hot to
hold even if soap-and-water has been playing upon the boring-machine.</p>

<p>The production of heat by chemical action is termed <em>combustion</em>, and
this is the means by which all artificial heat for our daily wants is supplied.
We can also produce heat by electricity. A familiar and not always
pleasant instance of this is seen in the flash of lightning which will fuse
metals, and experiment may do the same upon a smaller scale. These are,
in brief, the Sources of Heat, and we may speak of its effects.</p>

<p>We may take it for granted that no matter from what source heat
is derived, it exhibits the same phenomena in its relation to objects. One
of the most usual of these phenomena is expansion. Let us take water,
and see the effect of heat upon it.</p>

<p>We know that a certain weight of water under the same conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
has always the same volume; and although the attributes of the liquid
vary under different circumstances, under the <em>same</em> conditions its properties
are exactly the same. Now, water expands very much when under the
influence of heat, like all liquids; solids and gases also expand upon the
application of heat.</p>

<p>We can easily establish these statements. A metallic ring when
heated is larger than when cool. A small quantity of air in a bladder
when heated will fill the bladder, and water will boil over the vessel, or
expand into steam, and perhaps burst the boiler. So expansion is the
tendency of what we term heat.</p>

<p>We make use of this quality of heat in the thermometer, by which
we can measure the temperature not only of liquids or solids, but of the
atmosphere. The reading of the thermometer varies in different countries,
for the degrees are differently marked, but the construction of the instrument
is the same. It is called thermometer from two Greek words
signifying the measure of heat. It is a notable fact that Castelli, writing
in 1638, says to Ferdinand Cæsarina: “I remembered an experiment which
Signor Galileo had shown me more than thirty-five years ago. He took
a glass bottle about the size of a hen’s egg, the neck of which was two
palms long, and as narrow as a straw. Having well heated the bulb in
his hands, he placed its mouth in a vessel containing water, and withdrawing
the heat of his hand from the bulb, the water instantly rose in
the neck more than a palm above the level of the water in the
vessel.”</p>

<p>Here, then, we have an air-thermometer, but as it was affected by the
<em>pressure</em> as well as the temperature of the atmosphere, it could not be relied
upon as a “measurer of heat.” Until Torricelli propounded the principle
of the barometer, this “weather-glass” of Galileo was used, for the philosopher
divided the stem into divisions, and the air-thermometer served the
purpose of our modern instruments.</p>

<p>The actual inventor of the thermometer is not known. It has been
attributed to Galileo, to Drebbel, and to Robert Fludd. There is little
doubt, however, that Galileo and Drebbel were both acquainted with it,
but whether either claimed the honour of the invention, whether they
discovered it independently, or together, we cannot say. Sanctorio, of
Padua, and Drebbel have also been credited with the invention. We may
add that the spirit thermometer was invented in 1655-1656. It was a
rough form of our present thermometer, and roughly graduated. But it
was hermetically closed to the air, and a great improvement on the old
“weather-glass. Edmond Halley introduced mercury as the liquid for the
instrument in 1680. Otto von Guerike first suggested the freezing point
of water as the lowest limit, and Renaldini, in 1694, proposed that the
boiling and freezing points of water should be the limit of the scale.</p>

<p>Let us now explain the construction and varied markings of the three
kinds of thermometers in use. By noting the differences between the scales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
every reader will be able to read the records from foreign countries noted
upon the Centigrade and Réaumur instruments, which are
all based upon the theory that heat expands liquids.</p>

<p>[We used to hear the expression, “Heat expands,
and cold contracts,” but we trust that all our readers
have now learnt that there is no such thing as <em>cold</em>.
It is only a negative term. We feel things cold because
they extract some warmth from our fingers, not because
the substances have no heat.]</p>

<p>Thermometers are made of very fine bore glass
tubes. One end has a bowl, or bulb, the other is at first
open. By heating the bowl the air in the tube is driven
away by the open end, which is quickly dipped in a
bowl of mercury. The mercury will then occupy a
certain space in the tube; and if it be heated till the
liquid boils, all the air will be driven out by the mercurial
vapour. By once again dipping the tube in the quicksilver
the glass will be filled. Then, before it cools, close
the open end of the tube, and the thermometer is so far
made. Having now caught our thermometer we must
proceed to mark it, which is an easy process. By
plunging the mercury into pounded melting ice we can
get the freezing point, and boiling water will give us
the boiling point. The intermediate scale can be then
indicated.</p>

<p>If mercury and glass expanded equally there would
be no rise in the latter. Extreme delicacy of the thermometer
can be arrived at by using a very fine tube, particularly
if it be also flat.</p>

<p>The freezing point in Fahrenheit’s scale is 32°; in
the Centigrade it is 0°, and the boiling point 100°. This
was the scale adopted by Celsius, a Swede, and is much
used. Réaumur called the freezing point 0°, and the
boiling point 80°. There is another scale, almost obsolete,—that
of Delisle, who called boiling point zero, and
freezing point 150°.</p>

<p>There is no difficulty in converting degrees on one
scale into degrees on the other. Fahrenheit made his
zero at the greatest cold he could get; viz., snow and
salt. The freezing point of water is 32° above his
zero. Therefore 212-32 gives 180° the difference
between the freezing and boiling points of water. So
180° Fahr. corresponds to 100° Cent., and to 80°
Réaumur, reckoning from freezing point.</p>

<p>The following tables will explain the differences:—</p>

<p>Alcohol is used in thermometers in very cold districts, as it does not
freeze even at a temperature of -132° Fahr.</p>

<p>We have now explained the way in which we can measure heat by the
expansion of mercury in a tube. We can also find out that solids and
gases expand also. Engineers always make allowances for the effects of
winter and summer weather when building bridges; in summer the bridge
gets longer, and unless due provision were made it would become strained
and weakened. So there are compensating girders, and the structure
remains safe.</p>

<p>The effects of expansion by heat are very great and very destructive
at times. Instances of boilers bursting will occur to every reader. It is
very important to be able to ascertain the extent to which solid bodies will
expand. Such calculations have been made, and are in daily use.</p>

<p>We can crack a tumbler by pouring hot water into it, or by placing it
on the “hob.” A few minutes’ consideration will assure us that the lower
particles of the glass expanded before the rest, and cracked our tumbler. A
gradual heating, particularly if the glass be thin, will ensure safety. Thick
glass will crack sooner than thin.</p>

<p>Again, many people at railway stations have asked us, “Why don’t they
join the rails together on this line?” We reply that if every length of rail
were tightly fixed against its neighbour, the whole railway would be displaced.
The iron expands and joins up close in hot weather. In wet weather, also,
the wooden pegs and the sleepers swell with moisture, and get tightened up.
Everyone knows how much more smoothly a train travels in warm, wet
weather. This is due to the expansion of the iron and the swelling of the
sleepers and pegs in the “chairs.” A railway 400 miles long expands 338<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
yards in summer,—that is the difference in length between the laid railroad
in summer and in winter.</p>

<p>This can be proved. Iron expands 0·001235 of its length for every 180°
Fahr. Divided by 180 it gives us the expansion for 1°, which is 0·00000686,
taking the difference of winter and summer at 70° Fahr. Multiply these
together, and the result (0·00048620 of its length) by the number of yards
in 400 miles, and we find our answer 338 yards. Expansion acts in solids
and most liquids by the destruction of cohesion between the particles.
Gases, however, having much less cohesion amid the particles, will expand far
more under a given heat than either solids or liquids, and liquids expand
more than solids for the same reason, and more rapidly at a high temperature
than at a low one.</p>

<p>We have spoken of expansion. We may give an instance in which the
subsequent contraction of heated metal is useful. Walls sometimes get out
of the perpendicular, and require pulling together. No force which can be
conveniently applied would accomplish this so well as the cooling force due
to the potential energy of iron. Rods are passed through the walls and
braced up by nuts. The rods are then heated, and as they cool they contract
and pull the walls with them.</p>

<p>When glass is suddenly cooled, the inner skin, as it were, presses with
great force against the cooled surface, but as it is quite tight no explosion
can follow. But break the tail, or scratch it with a diamond, and the strain
is taken off. The glass drop crumbles with the effect of the explosion, as
in the cases of Prince Rupert’s drops, and the Bologna flasks; the continuity
is broken, and pulverization results.</p>

<p>But a very curious exception to the general laws of expansion is
noticed in the case of nearly freezing water. We know water expands by
heat, at first gradually, and then to an enormous extent in steam. But when
cooling water, instead of getting more and more contracted, only contracts
down to 39·2° Fahr., it then begins to expand, and at the moment it freezes
into ice it expands very much—about one-twelfth of its volume, but according
to Professor Huxley it weighs exactly the same, and the steam produced from
that given quantity of water will weigh just exactly what the water and the
ice produced by it weigh individually. At 39·2° Fahr. water is at its
maximum density, or in other words, a vessel of a certain size will hold
more water when it is at 39° Fahr. than at any other time. Whether the
water be heated or cooled at this temperature, it <em>expands</em> to the boiling or
freezing point when it becomes steam or ice, as the case may be.</p>

<p>Water, when heated, is lighter than cold water. You can prove this in
filling a bath from two taps of hot and cold water at the same time. The
cold falls to the bottom, and if you do not stir up the water when mixed
you will have a hot surface and a cold foundation. The heat increases the
volume of water, it becomes lighter, and comes uppermost.</p>

<p>Steam and Water and Ice are all the same things under different conditions,
although to the eye they are so different. They are alike inasmuch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
as a given weight of water will weigh as much when converted into ice or
developed into steam. The half ounce of water will weigh half an ounce as
ice or as steam, but the volume or bulk will vary greatly, as will be understood
when we state that one cubic inch of water will produce 1,700 cubic inches
of steam, and 1-1/11 cubic inch of ice; but at the same time each will yield,
when decomposed, just the same amount of oxygen and hydrogen.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the <em>Effects of Heat upon Water</em>. We have all seen
the vapour that hangs above a locomotive engine. We call it “steam.” It
is not pure steam, for steam is really invisible. The visible vapour is steam
on its way to become water again. On a very hot dry day we cannot
distinguish the vapour at all.</p>

<p>The first effect of heat upon water is to expand it; and as the heat
is applied we know that the water continues to expand and bubble up; and
at last, when the temperature is as high as 212°, we say water “boils”—that
is, at that heat it begins to pass away in vapour, and you will find
that the temperature of the steam is the same as the boiling water. While
undergoing this transformation, the water increases in volume to 1,700 times
its original bulk, although it will weigh the same as the water. So steam
has 1,700 less specific gravity than water.</p>

<p>It is perhaps scarcely necessary to remind our readers that water, when
heated, assumes tremendous force. Air likewise expands with great violence,
and the vessels containing either steam or air frequently burst, with destructive
effects. Solid bodies also expand when heated, and the most useful and
accurate observations have been made, so that the temperatures at which solid
bodies expand are now exactly known. Air also expands by heat.</p>

<p>While speaking of Expansion by Heat, we may remark that a rapid
movement is imparted to the air by Heat. In any ordinary room the air
below is cool, while if we mount a ladder to hang up a picture, for instance,
we shall find the air quite hot near the ceiling. This is quite in keeping
with the effects of heat upon water. The hot particles rise to the top in a
vessel, and thus a motion is conveyed to the water. So in our rooms. The
heated air rushes up the chimney and causes a draught, and this produces
motion, as we have seen by fig. 39, in which the cardboard spiral was set in
motion by heated air. A balloon will ascend, because it is filled with heated
air or gas; and we all have seen the paper balloons which will ascend if a
sponge containing spirit of wine be set on fire underneath them.</p>

<p>Winds are also only currents of air produced by unequal temperature
in different places. The heated air ascends, and the colder fluid rushes in
sometimes with great velocity to fill the space. “Land” and “sea” breezes
are constant; the cool air blows in from the sea during the day, and as the
land cools more rapidly at night, the breeze passes out again. When we
touch upon <em>Meteorology</em>, we will have more to say respecting Air Currents and
the various Atmospheric Phenomena.</p>

<p>We know that water can be made to boil by heat, but it is not perhaps
generally known that it will apparently boil by <em>cold</em>, and the experiment may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
thus be made:—A flask half-full of water is maintained at ebullition for some
minutes. It is removed from the source of heat, corked, inverted, and placed
in one of the rings of a retort stand. If cold water is poured on the upturned
bottom of the flask, the fluid will start into violent ebullition. The upper
portion of the flask is filled with steam, which maintains a certain pressure
on the water. By cooling the upper portion of the flask some of this is
condensed, and the pressure reduced. The temperature at which water boils
varies with the pressure. When it is reduced, water boils at a lower heat.
By pouring the cold water over the flask we condense the steam so that the
water is hot enough to boil at the reduced pressure. To assert that water
boils by the application of cold is a chemical sophism.</p>

<p><em>Ebullition</em> and <em>Evaporation</em> may be now considered, and these are the
two principal modes by which liquids assume the gaseous condition. The
difference is, when water boils we term it ebullition (from the Latin <em>ebullio</em>, I
boil); evaporation means vapour given out by water not boiling (from
<em>evaporo</em>, I disperse in vapour).</p>

<p>There are two operations based upon the properties which bodies
possess of assuming the form of vapour under the influence of heat, which
are called <em>Distillation</em> and <em>Sublimation</em>. These we will consider presently.</p>

<p>Ebullition then means a bubbling up or boiling; and when water is
heated in an open vessel two forces oppose its conversion into vapour; viz.,
its own cohesive force and atmospheric pressure. At length, at 212° Fahr.,
the particles of water have gained by heat a force greater than the opposing
forces; bubbles of vapour rise up from the bottom and go off in vapour.
This is <em>ebullition</em>, and at that point the tension of the vapour is equal to the
pressure of the atmosphere, for if not, the bubbles would not form. All this
time of boiling, notwithstanding any increase of heat, the thermometer will not rise
above 212° (Fahr.), for all the heat is employed in turning the water to steam.</p>

<p>We have said the ebullition takes place at 212° Fahr. (or 100° C.), but
that is only at a certain level. If we ascend 600 feet high we shall find that
water will boil at a less temperature; and on the top of a mountain (say
Mont Blanc) water will boil at 185° Fahr.; so at an elevation of three miles
water boils at a temperature less by 27° Fahr. An increase of pressure
similarly will raise the boiling point of water. The heights of mountains
are often ascertained by noticing the boiling point of water on their summits,
the general rule being a fall of one degree for every 530 feet elevation at
medium altitudes. We append a few instances taken at random:—</p>

<p>[The difference for a degree depends upon the height, varying between
510 and 590 feet, according to the elevation reached. The approximate
height of a mountain can be found by multiplying 530 by the number of
degrees between the boiling point and 212°. In some very elevated regions
travellers have even failed to boil potatoes.]</p>

<p>The boiling point of liquid may be altered by mixing some substance
with it; and although such a substance as sawdust would not alter the
boiling point of water, yet if the foreign matter be dissolved in the liquid it
will alter the boiling point. Even the air dissolved in liquids alters their
boiling point, and water freed from air will not boil till it is raised to a
temperature much higher than 212° Fahr. Water will boil at a higher
temperature in a glass vessel than in metal, because there is a greater
attraction between water and glass.</p>

<p>We said above that an increase of pressure will raise the boiling point
of water. Under the pressure of one atmosphere—that is, when there is a
pressure of 15 lbs. on the square inch—water boils at 212°. But under a
pressure of two atmospheres, the boiling point rises to 234°, and of four atmospheres,
294°. So we see by increasing the pressure the water may be
almost indefinitely heated, and it will not boil. We can understand that in
a very deep vessel the layer of water at the bottom has to sustain the
pressure of the water in addition to the weight of the atmosphere above it.
The pressure of thirty-four feet of water is equal to the atmospheric pressure
of 15 lbs. on the square inch, and thus at such a distance water must be
heated to 234° before it will boil. Professor Bunsen founded his Theory
of the Geysers upon this fact, for he maintained that water falling into the
earth lost much air, and required with the super-incumbent pressure a very
high temperature to boil it. When it did boil it generated steam so
suddenly that it exploded upwards, throwing up vapour and the water with
it, as water poured into a very hot basin will do.</p>

<p><em>Evaporation</em> may now be considered, and is distinguished from Ebullition
by the production of vapour on the <em>surface</em> of liquids, the latter term signifying
the formation of vapour in <em>the body</em> of the liquid. Evaporation takes
place at all temperatures, and from every liquid surface exposed to the air.
We know what we call a “drying wind.” The air in fresh layers continually
passing over the wet ground, takes up the moisture; like the east wind, for
instance, which has great capabilities of that nature. Damp air can only
take up a certain quantity, and when it contains as much water as corresponds
to the temperature it can take no more, and is “saturated with
moisture”; then evaporation ceases. Heat is a great cause of evaporation,
and the greater the surface the more rapid the process, and in a vacuum
more readily than in atmospheric air. Evaporation is resorted to very
commonly to produce coolness; for instance, the universal fan, by increasing
evaporation from a heated skin, generates a feeling of coolness; and we
know the vaporization of ether will freeze into insensibility. When a fluid
evaporates we can tell that the heat passes away at the same time, for we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
cool water in porous jars, which permit some of it to pass off in vapour,
the remainder being cooled.</p>

<p>Sir John Leslie invented a method of freezing water by rapid evaporation
on sulphuric acid under the receiver of an air-pump, and water has
been frozen even on a <em>hot plate</em> by these means. By pouring sulphurous
acid and water on this plate, the acid evaporates so quickly that it produces
sufficient cold to freeze the water it quitted into solid ice.</p>

<p>We leave the phenomena of clouds and watery vapour in the atmosphere
for consideration on another opportunity, under the head of <em>Meteorology</em>,
<em>Rain</em>, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_085.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 80.—Apparatus for freezing carafes of water.</div>
</div>

<p>An experiment is often performed by which water is frozen in a vacuum.
By putting a saucer full of water under the receiver of an air-pump it will
first boil, and then become a solid mass of ice. It is not difficult to understand
the cause of this. The water boils as soon as the air is removed; but
in order to pass from the liquid to the gaseous state without the assistance
of exterior heat, it gives out heat to the surroundings, and in so doing
becomes ice itself. This fact Mr. Carré has made use of in the apparatus
shown above (fig. 80). A small pump creates a vacuum in the water bottles,
and ice is formed in them.</p>

<p>This apparatus might easily be adopted in country houses, and in places
where ice is difficult to procure in summer. The only inconvenience attending
it is the employment of sulphuric acid, of which a considerable quantity is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
used to absorb the vapour from the water, as already referred to. If proper
precautions are taken, however, there will be no danger in using the
apparatus.</p>

<p>The mode of proceeding is as follows:—The bottle full of water is joined
to the air-pump by a tube, and after a few strokes the water is seen in
ebullition. The vapour thus disengaged traverses an intermediate reservoir
filled with sulphuric acid, which absorbs it, and immediately condenses it,
producing intense cold. In the centre of the liquid remaining in the carafe
some needles of ice will be seen, which grow rapidly, and after a few more
strokes of the pump the water will be found transformed into a mass of ice.
This is very easy of accomplishment, and in less than a minute the carafe
full of water will be found frozen.</p>

<p>The problem for the truly economical formation of ice by artificial means
is one of those which have occupied chemists for a long time, but hitherto,
notwithstanding all their efforts, no satisfactory conclusion has been arrived
at. Nearly every arrangement possesses some drawback to its complete
success, which greatly increases the cost of the ice, and causes inconvenience
in its production. The usual mode in large towns is to collect the ice, in
houses constructed for the purpose, during the winter, and this simple
method is also the best, so far as at present has been ascertained.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_086.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 81.—Retort and Receiver.</div>
</div>

<p>In connection with vaporization we may now mention two processes
referred to just now (page 83); viz., sublimation and distillation. The
former is the means whereby we change solid bodies into vapour and condense
the vapour into proper vessels. The condensed substances when
deposited are called <em>sublimates</em>, and when we go into Chemistry we shall
hear more of them. The mode of proceeding is to place the substance in a
glass tube, and apply heat to it. Vapour will be formed, and will condense
at the cool end of the tube. The sublimate of sulphur is called “Flowers
of Sulphur,” and that of perchloride of mercury “Corrosive Sublimate.”</p>

<p>Distillation is a more useful process, or, at any rate, one more frequently
employed, and is used to separate a volatile body from substances not
volatile. A distilling apparatus (<i lang="la">distillo</i>, to drop) converts a liquid to
vapour by means of heat, and then condenses it by cold in a separate vessel.</p>

<p>The distilling apparatus consists of three parts,—the vessel in which the
liquid is heated (the still, or retort), the condenser, and the receiver. The
simple retort and receiver are shown in fig. 81. But when very volatile
vapours are dealt with, the arrangement shown on next page is used (fig. 82).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Then the vapour passes into the tube encased in a larger one, the intervening
space being filled with cold water from the tap above (<i>c</i>), the warm water
dropping from <i lang="la">g</i>. The vapours are thus condensed, and drop into the
bottle (or receiver) <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>.</p>

<p class="hang">SPECIFIC HEAT—FUSION—LATENT HEAT—CONDUCTION AND CONVECTION
OF HEAT—CALORESCENCE.</p>


<p>We have considered the effects of heat upon water, and touched upon one or
two kindred experiments. But we have some other subjects to discuss,
two in particular; viz., <em>Specific Heat</em>, and <em>Latent Heat</em>.</p>

<p>The specific heat of any substance is “the number of units of heat
required to raise one pound of such substance one degree.” We can explain
this farther. When heat is communicated to a body it has two or three
functions to perform. Some of it has to overcome the resistance of the air
in expanding the body, more of it expands, and the remainder increases
the temperature of the body. So some heat disappears as heat, and is
turned into energy,—“molecular potential energy,”—as it is called, and the
rest remains. Of course in objects the molecules vary very much in weight
and in their mutual attraction, and the heat requisite to raise equal weights
of different substances through the same number of degrees of temperature
will vary. This is called capacity for heat, or specific heat. The capacity
of different metals for heat can easily be shown. The specific heat of water
is very high, because its capacity for heat is great. We can cool a hot iron
in very little water, and it takes thirty times as much heat to raise a given
weight of water a certain number of degrees, as it would to raise the same
weight of mercury to the same temperature. Water has greater specific
heat, generally speaking, than other bodies, and it is owing to this circumstance
that the climate is so affected by ocean currents.</p>

<p>Nearly all substances can be melted by heat, if we go far enough, or
frozen, if we could take the heat away. Solid can be made liquid, and these
liquids can be made gases and fly off in vapour. Similarly, if we could
only get heat away sufficiently from the atoms of a substance we could
freeze it. We cannot freeze alcohol, nor make ice from air, nor can we liquify
it, for we are unable to take away its heat sufficiently. But we can turn
water into steam, and into ice; or ice into water, and then into steam. But
there is one body we cannot melt by heat, that is carbon. In the hottest
fire coal will not melt, it becomes soft. We call this melting <em>fusion</em>, and
every body has its melting point, or fusing point, which is the same at all
times if the air pressure be the same.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that when a body is melting it rises to a certain
temperature (its fusing point), and then gets no hotter, no matter whether or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
not the fire be increased;—all the extra heat goes to melt the remainder of
the substance. The heat only produces <em>changes of state</em>. So this heat above
fusing point disappears apparently, and is called <em>Latent Heat</em>. This can
easily be proved by melting ice. Ice melts at 32° Fahr., or 0° Cent., and at
that temperature it will remain so long as any ice is left; but the water at
32°, into which the ice has melted, contains a great deal of <em>latent</em> heat, for
it has melted the ice quickly, and yet the thermometer does not show it. It
is just the same with boiling water.</p>

<p>When substances are fused they expand as a rule, but ice contracts; so
does antimony. On the other hand, when water solidifies it does not
contract as most things do. It expands, as many of us are aware, by finding
our water pipes burst in the winter; and the geologist will tell us how the
tiny trickling rills of water fall in between the cracks of rocks and there
freeze. In freezing the drops expand and split the granite blocks. Type-metal
expands also when it becomes solid, and leaves us a clear type; but
copper contracts, and won’t do for moulding, so we have to stamp it when
we want an impression on it.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that chemical combinations produce heat, as we can
see every day in house-building operations, when water is poured upon lime;
but there are also chemical combinations which produce cold. Fahrenheit
produced his greatest cold by combining snow and salt, for in the act of
combining, a great quantity of heat is swallowed up by reason of the heat
becoming latent, as it will do when solid bodies become liquid. Such
mixtures or combinations are used as <em>Freezing Mixtures</em> when it is necessary
to produce intense cold artificially. Sulphate of Sodium and Hydrochloric
acid will also produce great cold, and there are many other combinations
equally or even more efficacious.</p>

<p>Heat is communicated to surrounding objects in three well-known
ways—by conduction, by radiation, and by convection. Conduction of heat
is easily understood, and is the propagation of heat through any body, and
it varies very much according to the substance through which it passes.
Some substances are better conductors of heat than others. Silver has a
far greater conductivity than gold, and copper is a better heat-conductor than
tin. Flannel is a non-conductor, or rather a bad conductor, for no substance
can be termed actually a non-conductor. Flannel, we know, will keep ice
from melting, and a sheep’s wool or a bird’s feathers are also bad conductors
of heat; so Nature has provided these coverings to keep in the animal heat
of the body. A good conductor of heat feels cold to the touch of our fingers,
because it takes the heat from our hands. This can be tried by touching
silver, lead, marble, wood, and wool. Each in turn will feel cold and less
cold, because they respectively draw away, or conduct less and less heat from
our bodies. So our clothes are made of bad-conducting substances. The
bark of a tree is a bad conductor, and if you strip off this clothing the tree
will die.</p>

<p>Solids conduct heat the better the more compact they are. Air being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
a bad conductor it follows that the less tightly the molecules are packed the
less conductibility there will be; and even a substance powdered will be a
worse conductor than the same substance in solid form; and also more
readily in the direction of the fibres than crossways.</p>

<p>Liquids do not possess great conductivity, but they, as well as gases,
are influenced by <em>convection</em>, or the transport of heat from the bottom layers
to the top (<i>conveho</i>, to carry up). We have already mentioned that the
heated particles of water rise to the top because they expand, and so become
lighter. This is convection of heat; and by it liquids and gases, though
actually bad conductors, may become heated throughout to a uniform temperature.
Of course the more easily expansible the body is the more
rapidly will convection take place—so gases are more readily affected than
liquids. Solids are not affected, because convection of heat depends upon
molecular movement or mobility, and it is obvious that the particles of solid
bodies are not mobile. Professor Balfour Stewart says with reference to this
that “were there no gravity there would be no convection,” for the displacement
of the light warm particles by the heavier cold ones is due to gravity.
The instances of convection of heat in nature are numerous, and on a gigantic
scale. The ocean currents, trade winds, lake freezing, etc., while the chimney
draught already referred to, is another example; and in all these cases the
particles of air or water are replaced by convection. In the case of the
lake freezing the cold particles at the top sink, and the warmer ones ascend,
until all the lake is at a temperature of 36·2°, or say 4° above freezing. At
this temperature water assumes its maximum density, and then <em>expands</em>, as
we have seen, instead of contracting. Ice is formed,
and being thus lighter than water, floats; and so unites
to cover in the water underneath, which is never frozen
solid, because the cold of the atmosphere cannot reach
it through the ice in time to solidify the whole mass.</p>

<img src="images/i_090.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 84.—Radiant heat.</div>
</div>

<p>Radiant heat is the motion of heat transmitted to
the ether, and through it in the form of waves. The
sun’s heat is radiant heat, and radiation may be defined
as “The communication of the motion of heat from the
articles of a heated substance to the ether.” The fire gives
out radiant heat, and so does heated metal, and it is
transmitted by an unseen medium. It is quite certain
that the heat of a suspended red-hot poker is not communicated
to the air, because it will cool equally in a
vacuum. Sir Humphrey Davy proved that radiant
heat could traverse a vacuum, for by putting tin reflectors
in an exhausted receiver he found that a hot substance
in the focus of one reflector caused an increase in the
heat of the other. If we put a red-hot or a hot substance
in one reflector, and tinder in the other, the latter will take fire.
The velocity of heat rays is equal to that of light, 186,000 miles in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
second, and indeed, radiant heat is identical with light. Heat is reflected
as is light, and is refracted in the same way as sound.</p>

<p>Some bodies allow the heat rays to pass through them, as air does, and
as rock salt will do. White clothing is preferable in summer (and also in
winter if we could only make people believe it). White garments radiate
less heat in winter, and absorb less heat in summer. An old black kettle
will boil water more quickly than a new bright one, but the latter will keep
the water hotter for the longer time when not on the fire.</p>

<p>Heat, then, is movement of particles. Energy can be changed into
heat, as the savage finds when he rubs the bits of wood to produce heat
and fire. Friction causes heat, and chemical combination produces heat;
and, if “visible energy can be turned into heat, heat can be turned back
into visible energy.” For fire heats water, water expands into steam, and
steam produces motion and energy in the steam-engine.</p>

<p>If we heat water in Wollaston’s bulb,—the opening of which is
hermetically stopped by a piston,—the vapour will raise the piston. If we
cool the bulb we condense the steam, and the piston falls. Here we have
the principle of the steam-engine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steam</span> is the vapour of water educed by heat, and we may give a few
particulars concerning it. Its mechanical properties are the same as those
of other gases, and pure steam is colourless and transparent—in fact, invisible.
Its power when confined in boilers and subjected to pressure is enormous,
for the volume of the steam is far greater than the water which gave rise to
it. One cubic inch of water will produce 1,700 cubic inches of steam—in
other words, a cubic inch of water produces a cubic foot of steam. When
we obtain steam at 212°, we do so under the pressure of one atmosphere;
but by increasing the pressure we can raise the boiling point, and thus water
at the pressures of sixteen atmospheres will not steam till it reaches 398°.
It is thus we obtain pressure for locomotives, and other engines, although a
very small portion of the steam does work. Much the largest portion is
expended in overcoming cohesion, and one way and another, taking into
consideration defects in machinery, only about one-tenth of the heat is
employed in doing the work. The force exercised by steam under atmospheric
pressure is sufficient to raise a ton weight one foot.</p>

<p>To obtain very high temperatures we shall find the thermometer of no
use, for mercury boils at 662°, so an instrument called a Pyrometer is used
to ascertain the fusing point of metals. Mr. Wedgwood, the celebrated
china manufacturer, invented an instrument made of small cylinders of clay
moulded and backed, placed between two brass rods as gauges divided into
inches and tenths. But this instrument has been long superseded by
Professor Daniell’s Pyrometer, which consists of a small bar of platina in
an earthenware tube. The difference of expansion between the platina
and the tube is measured on a scale on which one degree is equal to seven
degrees of Fahrenheit. Thus the melting temperatures of metals are
ascertained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>The reflection and refraction of heat are ruled by the same laws as the
reflection and refraction of light. A convex lens will bring the heat or
light to a focus, and will act as a burning-glass if held in the sunlight.
Gunpowder has been ignited by a lens of ice, and more than one house has
been mysteriously set on fire at midday in summer by the sun’s rays shining
through a glass globe of water containing gold fish, and falling upon some
inflammable substance. Professor Tyndall performed a series of experiments
of a very interesting nature, described in his book, “Heat considered
as a Mode or Motion,” and showed the transmutation of invisible heat rays
into visible rays, by passing a beam of electric light through an opaque
solution, and concentrating it upon a lens. The dark heat rays were thus
brought to a focus, all the light was cut off, and at the dark focus the heat
was found to be intense enough to melt copper and explode gunpowder.
This change of invisible heat into light is termed Calorescence.</p>

<p>It was Sir William Herschell who discovered that there were heat rays
beyond the red end of the spectrum. When light is split up into its component
rays, or decomposed, Sir William found that the heat increased as
the thermometer passed from violet to indigo, and so on to blue, green,
orange, and red, and the last were the hottest, while beyond the spectrum
there was heat even greater. A <em>Heat Spectrum</em> was thus discovered, and by
comparing, by means of the thermometer, the various degrees of heat within
certain limits, Professor Tyndall found that the invisible Heat Spectrum is
longer than the visible Light Spectrum.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="hang">LIGHT AND ITS SOURCES—WHAT IS LIGHT?—VELOCITY OF LIGHT—REFLECTION
AND REFRACTION—RELATIVE VALUE OF LIGHTS.</p>


<p>The subject of Light and the science of Optics are so interesting to all
of us that some short history of light is necessary before we can enter
upon the scientific portion of the subject. The nature of the agent (as we
may term light) upon which our sight depends has employed man’s mind
from a very early period. The ancients were of opinion that the light
proceeded <em>from</em> the eye to the object looked at. But they discovered some
of the properties of light. Ptolemy of Alexandria, who was born <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 70,
made some attempts to discover the law of Refraction; and we are informed
that Archimedes set the Roman fleet on fire with burning-glasses at Syracuse.
The Arabian treatise of Alhagen, in 1100 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, contains a description of the
eye and its several parts; and the writer notices refraction and the effects of
magnifying glasses (or spectacles). Galen, the physician, practically discovered
the principle of the stereoscope, for he laid down the law that our
view of a solid body is made up of two pictures seen by each eye separately.</p>

<p>Still the science of optics made little progress till the law determining
the path of a ray of light was made known, and the laws of refraction
discovered. Refraction means that a ray is deflected from its straight course
by its passage from one transparent medium to another of different density.
The old philosophers found out the theory of sound, and they applied themselves
to light. Newton said light consisted of minute particles emanating
from luminous bodies. Huyghens and Euler opposed Newton’s theory of
the emission of light; and it was not till the celebrated Thomas Young,
Professor at the Royal Institution, grappled with the question that the
undulating or wave theory of light was found out. He based his investigations
upon the theory of sound waves; and we know that heat, light, and
sound are most wonderfully allied in their manner of motion by vibration.
But he was ridiculed, and his work temporarily suppressed by Mr. Brougham.</p>

<p>Light, then, is a vibratory motion (like sound and heat), a motion of
the atoms of our ether. But how is the motion transmitted? Sound has
its medium, air; and in a vacuum sounds will be very indistinctly heard, if
heard at all. But what is the medium of communication of light? It is
decided that light is transmitted through a medium called <em>ether</em>, a very
elastic substance surrounding us. The vibrations, Professor Tyndall and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
other philosophers tell us, of the luminous atoms are communicated to this
ether, or propagated through it in waves; these waves enter the pupil of the
eye, and strike upon the retina. The motion is thus communicated by the
optic nerve to the brain, and then arises the great primary faculty, Consciousness.
We see light, the waves of which, or ether vibrations, are
transversal; air waves or sound vibrations are longitudinal.</p>

<p>We have spoken of radiant heat. Light acts in the same way through
the ether; and when we consider Sound we shall learn that a certain number
of vibrations of a string give a certain sound, and the quicker the vibration
the shriller the tone. So in light. The more quickly the waves of luminosity
travel to our eye, and the faster they strike it, the greater the difference in
the <em>colour</em>, or what we call colour. Light as we see it is composed of
different colours, as visible in the rainbow. There are seven primary colours
in the sunlight, which is white. These can be divided or “dispersed,” and
the shortest rays of the spectrum are found to be violet, the longest red. It
has been calculated that 39,000 red waves make an inch in length. Light
travels at a rate of nearly 190,000 miles a second, so if we multiply the
number of inches in that distance by the number of red waves, we shall have
millions of millions of waves entering the eye in a single second of time.
The other waves enter more rapidly still, and “the number of shocks corresponding
to the impression of violet is seven hundred and eighty-nine
millions of millions” per second! Or taking the velocity of light at 186,000
miles in a second, it would be six hundred and seventy-eight millions of
millions (Tyndall). There may be other colours which we cannot see because
the impressions come too rapidly upon the retina; but the violet impression
has been thus accurately determined. See page 168.</p>

<p>We have seen that heat is a kind of motion of particles in a body—a
vibratory motion which, instead of being apparent to the ear, is apparent
to the eye in rays of light. Thus heat, sound, and light are all intimately
connected in this way. We have also learnt that rays of light radiate and
travel with tremendous speed to our eyes, but without any shock. There is
no feeling connected with the entrance of light to the eye any more than
there is any sensation of sound when entering the ear, except when the light
is vividly and very suddenly revealed, or when a very piercing sound is heard.
Then the nerves are excited, and a painful sensation is the result; but under
ordinary circumstances we are not physically conscious of the entrance of
light or sound.</p>

<p>Heat and light are considered to be one and the same thing in different
degrees of intensity. The sources of light are various. The sun and fixed
stars, heat, electricity, many animals, and some plants, as well as decaying
animal matter, give out light. There are luminous and non-luminous bodies.
The moon is non-luminous, as she derives her light from the sun, as does the
earth, etc.</p>

<p>Light is distributed in rays. These rays are straight in all directions.
The velocity of light is almost inconceivable. It travels at a rate of 186,500<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
miles a second. The latest computation with electric light has given a rate
of 187,200 miles a second; but the blue rays in the light experimented on
probably account for the difference, for blue rays travel quicker by one per
cent. than red rays. Römer first found out the velocity of light, which
comes to us from the sun—ninety millions of miles—in eight minutes.
Fizeau calculated the velocity by means of a wheel, which was set moving
with tremendous speed by making the light pass between the teeth of the
wheel and back again.</p>

<p>When rays of light meet substances they are deflected, and the phenomena
under these circumstances are somewhat similar to the phenomena of
heat and sound. There are three particular conditions of rays of light: (1) they
are absorbed; (2) they are reflected; (3) they are refracted.</p>

<p>Firstly. Let us see what we mean by light being absorbed; and this is
not difficult to understand, for any “black” substance shows us at once that
all the sunlight is taken in by the black object, and does not come out again.
It does not take in the light and radiate it, as it might heat. The rose is
red, because the rays of light pass through it, and certain of them are reflected
from within. So colour may be stated to be the rays thrown out by the
objects themselves—those they reject or reflect being the “colour” of the
object.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_095.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 85.—Angle of reflection, etc.</div>
</div>

<p>Secondly. Bodies which reflect light very perfectly are known as
mirrors, and they are termed plane, concave, or convex mirrors, according to
form. A plane mirror reflects so that the reflected ray <i>d i</i>
forms the same angle with the perpendicular as the incident
ray <i>r i</i>; in other words, the angle of incidence is always
equal to the angle of reflection, and these rays are perpendicular
to the plane from which they are reflected. The
rays diverge, so that they appear to come from a point as far behind the mirror
as the luminous point is in front, and the images reflected have the same
appearance, but reversed. There is another law, which is that “the angular
velocity of a beam reflected from a mirror is twice that of the mirror.” The
Kaleidoscope, with which we are all familiar, is based upon the fact of the
multiplication of images by two mirrors inclining towards each other.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_095b.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 86.—Concave mirror.</div>
</div>

<p>A concave mirror is seen in the accompanying
diagram, and may be called the segment
of a hollow sphere—<span class="smcap lowercase">V W</span>. The point <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> is the
geometrical centre, and <span class="smcap lowercase">O C</span> the radius; <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span> is the
focus; the line passing through it is the <em>optical</em>
axis; <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span> being the <em>optical centre</em>. All perpendicular
rays pass through <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>. All rays falling in a
direction parallel with the optical axis are
reflected and collected at <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span>. Magnified images
will be produced, and if the object be placed
between the mirror and the focus, the image
will appear at the back; while if the object be placed between the geo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>metrical
centre and the focus, the image will appear to be in front of
the mirror.</p>

<p>We can understand these phenomena by the accompanying diagrams.
Suppose a ray <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> <i>n</i> passes from one object, <span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span>, at right angles, it will be
reflected as <i>n</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">A C</span>, the ray <span class="smcap lowercase">A C</span> being reflected to <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span>. These cannot meet in
front of the mirror, but they will if produced meet at <i>a</i>, and the point <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> will
be reflected there; similarly <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> will be reflected at <i>b</i>, and thus a magnified
image will appear behind or at the back of the mirror’s surface. In the next
diagram the second supposed case will produce the image in the air at
<i>a b</i>, and if a sheet of paper be held so that the rays are intercepted, the
image will be visible on the sheet. In this case the perpendicular ray, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> <i>n</i>,
is reflected in the same direction, and the ray, <i>a c</i>, parallel with the axis is
reflected to the focus. These rays meet at <i>a</i> and corresponding rays at <i>b</i>,
when the image will be reproduced; viz., in front of the mirror.</p>

<p>The concave mirror is used in the manufacture of telescopes, which,
with other optical instruments, will be described in their proper places. We
will now look at the <em>Refraction</em> of light.</p>

<p>Bodies which permit rays of light to pass through them are termed
transparent. Some possess this property more than others, and so long as
the light passes through the same medium the direction will remain the
same. But if a ray fall upon a body of a different degree of density it
cannot proceed in the same direction, and it will be broken or <em>refracted</em>,
the angle it makes being termed the angle of refraction.</p>

<p>For instance, a straight stick when plunged into water appears to be
broken at the point of immersion. This appearance is caused by the rays
of light taking a different direction to our eyes.
If in the diagram (fig. 89) our eye were at <i>o</i>, and
the vessel were empty, we should not see <i>m</i>; but
when water is poured into the vessel the object
will appear higher up at <i>n</i>, and all objects under
water appear higher than they really are.</p>

<p>One may also place a piece of money at the
bottom of a basin, and then stoop down gradually,
until, the edge of the basin intervening, the coin is lost to view. If an
operator then fills the basin with water, the piece of money appears as
though the bottom had been raised. The glass lenses used by professors
may be very well replaced by a round water-bottle full of water. A candle
is lighted in the darkness, and on holding the bottle between the light and
a wall which acts as a screen, we see the reflected light turned upside down
by means of the convergent lens we have improvised (fig. 90). A balloon
of glass constitutes an excellent microscope. It must be filled with perfectly
clear, limpid water, and closed by means of a cork. A piece of wire is
then rolled round its neck, and one end is raised, and turned up towards the
focus; viz., to support the object we wish to examine, which is magnified
several diameters. If a fly, for instance, is at the end of the wire, we find
it is highly magnified when seen through the glass balloon (fig. 91). By
examining the insect through the water in the balloon, we can distinguish
every feature of its organism, thanks to this improvised magnifier. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
little apparatus may also serve to increase the intensity of a luminous focus
of feeble power, such as a lighted candle. It is often employed in this
manner by watchmakers. If a bottle full of water is placed on a table, and
exposed to the rays of the sun, the head of a lucifer match being placed in
the brightest centre of light caused by the refracted rays, the match will not
fail to ignite. I have succeeded in this experiment even under an October
sun, and still more readily in warm weather.</p>

<p>In the Conservatoire des Arts in Paris a visitor will always notice a
number of people looking at the mirrors in the “optical” cabinets. These
mirrors deform and distort objects in a very curious manner, and people find
much amusement in gazing into them till they are “moved on” by the
attendants. Such experiments create great interest, and a very excellent
substitute for these may be found in a coffee-pot or even in a large spoon,
and all the grotesque appearance will be seen in the polished surface. The
least costly apparatus will sometimes produce the most marvellous effects.
Look at a soap-bubble blown from the end of a straw. When the sphere
has a very small diameter the pellicule is colourless and transparent; but
as the air enters by degrees, pressing upon all parts of the concave surface
equally, the bubble gets bigger as the thickness decreases, and then the
colours appear,—feeble at first, but stronger and stronger as the thickness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
diminishes. The study of soap-bubbles and of the effects of the light is
very interesting. Newton made the soap-bubble the object of his studies
and meditations, and it will ever hold its place amongst the curious phenomena
of the Science of Optics. But before going into all the phases of
Lights and Optics we will proceed to explain the structure of the eye, as it
is through that organ that we are enabled to appreciate light and its marvellous
effects.</p>

value of two lights. Nothing, however, can be easier in reality, as we will
show. In comparing different lights, it is necessary to bear in mind the
amount of waste, the colour of the light, the luminous value of the source,
and the steadiness of the flame. The luminous value of a lamp-burner is
generally equalled by that of a wax candle, and we will take as an example
one of those at six to the pound. Very precise appliances are used for
this experiment when great exactness is required; but it is easy to calculate
in a simple manner the differences in ordinary lights. Supposing we desire
to test the value of light given by a lamp and a wax candle, they must both
be placed on the table at an equal height, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, (fig. 93), in front of
some opaque body, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, and then a large sheet of paper must be fixed as
vertically as possible to form a screen. When <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> are lighted, two
shadows, <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span>, are produced, to which it is easy to give exactly the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
intensity, by advancing or withdrawing one of the two sources of light.
The intensities of the two lights will then be inversely proportional to the
squares of the measured distances, <span class="smcap lowercase">AB</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">AC</span>. By a similar careful calculation
it has been possible to draw up a table of the relative values
of various ordinary lights. We have not included here the electric light,
which has recently attracted so much attention, because this system of
lighting can hardly be said to have yet penetrated the domain of domestic
life; but when we consider electricity, as we hope to do in a future part, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
intend to study this question fully, for there is no doubt that electricity is
becoming more and more adapted to our daily life.</p>

<p>The measurement of intensity of light is called <em>Photometry</em>, and the
instruments used are <em>Photometers</em>. Bunsen’s instrument consists of a screen
of writing-paper, saturated in places with spermaceti to make it transparent.
A sperm candle is placed on one side, and the light to be compared on the
other. The lights are provided with graduated bars, and these lights are
then removed farther and farther from the screen till the spots of grease are
invisible. The relative intensities are as the squares of the distance from
the screen.</p>

<p>There are many other interesting experiments connected with Light,—Spectrum
Analysis, etc., etc.,—all of which we will defer for a time until we
have examined the Eye and some effects produced upon it by Light, illustrated
by numerous diagrams in the pages next following.</p>

<p class="hang">VISION AND OPTICAL ILLUSIONS—THE EYE DESCRIBED—ACCOMMODATION
OF THE EYE—CHROMATIC ABERRATION—SPINNING TOPS.</p>


<p>The eye is an optical instrument that may be compared with those constructed
by physicists themselves; the <em>media</em> of which it is composed
have surfaces like those which enter into the construction of optical instruments.
It was Kepler who at the end of the eighteenth century discovered
the passage of light into the eye. Soon after the discovery of the inner
chamber he found that the eye realized the conditions that Porta had combined
to obtain the reflection of external objects.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_102.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 95.—Structure of the eye.</div>
</div>

<p>We will now briefly state that the coats of this organ are constituted of
a fibrous membrane, <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span> (fig. 95), termed <em>sclerotic</em>, which is opaque, except in the
anterior portion of the eye, where it forms
the transparent <em>cornea</em>. The crystalline, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>,
enshrined behind the cornea, is the convergent
lens of the inner chamber; it is
covered with a transparent membrane,
or <em>capsule</em>, and is bathed in two fluids, the
<em>aqueous humour</em>, between the crystalline
humour and the cornea, and the <em>vitreous
body</em>, a gelatinous humour lodged between
the crystalline and the back of the eye.
The image of exterior objects which is
produced by the passage of light through these refracting surfaces, is
received by a nervous membrane, the <em>retina</em>, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, formed by an expansion of
the optic nerve, <span class="smcap lowercase">N</span>. We must also mention the <em>choroid</em>, a membrane lined
with a dark pigment, which absorbs the light, and prevents interior reflections,
and in front of the crystalline lens, a curtain with an opening, <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>,
called the <em>iris</em>, which gives to the eyes their colour of blue, grey, or black.
The opening in the centre of the iris is called the <em>pupil</em>.</p>

<p>The penetration of light through the surfaces of the eye is easily
demonstrated. An object throws divergent rays on the cornea, a part penetrates
into the eye and falls upon the retina, leaving a perfectly retained
image of the object. Magendie has proved in the following manner the truth
of this mathematical deduction. The eye of a rabbit is very similar to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
albino’s; that is to say, the choroid contains no black pigment, but a transparent
matter, and when placed before a brilliant object, the image can be
seen inverted on the retina. The experiment succeeds also with the eye of
a sheep or a cow, if the sclerotic has been lessened. The <em>optic centre</em> of the
eye is the point where the secondary axes cross; the <em>optic axis</em> passes through
the geometrical axis of the organ, and directs itself spontaneously towards
the point that attracts the eye.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_103.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 96.—Diagram of mode of vision.</div>
</div>

<p>We will now point out in what distinct vision consists. A screen
placed behind a lens will only receive the image of a lighted object, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, if
placed in a position, <span class="smcap lowercase">R</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">R</span> (fig. 96). If
placed nearer at <span class="smcap lowercase">R″</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">R″</span>, or further off at
<span class="smcap lowercase">R´</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">R´</span>, the light from the object is thrown
on the screen, and the image is confused.
To prove the imperfection of sight which
is shown by the application of these theoretic
rules, MM. Boutan and d’Alméïda<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
cite the following experiment:—If the
head of a pin is placed from one to two inches from the eye, nothing
will be perceived but a confused haziness of vague outline. The distance
of distinct vision is that at which an object of small dimensions may be
placed to be plainly perceived. This distance, which averages fifteen inches,
varies with different individuals. It can be determined for different sights by
means of an apparatus constructed by Lepot. A white thread, <i>a</i>, is stretched
horizontally on a dark board (fig. 97). We look at it by placing our eye
at one end behind a little screen pierced with an aperture, <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>; it then appears
much reduced in length, but either nearer or farther off it seems to enlarge
and swell, having the appearance of a white surface, becoming larger and
larger in proportion as we move away
from the point at which it is seen most
distinctly. In this manner we can
easily obtain a measure of the distance
of distinct vision. One of the most
remarkable properties of the eye consists
in the faculty which this organ
possesses of seeing different distances. If we consider it as a dark
chamber, there is but one distance at which an object will be perfectly
visible; nevertheless a metal wire, for example, can be seen as well at a
distance of seven, as ten, fifteen, or twenty inches by good sights.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_103b.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 97.—Experiment for sight.</div>
</div>

<p>This faculty of accommodation in the eye is thus demonstrated: we
place two pins, one in front of the other, one eye only being open; we
first look at the nearest pin, which appears confused if it is near
the eye, but by an effort of will the image becomes clear. If, while
preserving the clearness of the image, we then carry our attention to
the second pin, we find that it, too, presents a confused appearance.
If we make an effort to distinguish the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> contour of the second
pin, we at last succeed, and the first once more appears ill-defined.
It is only since the experiments of M. Cramer and M. Helmholtz that
the explanation of this phenomenon could have been given. M. Cramer
has succeeded in determining on the living eye the curved ray of the
cornea, and of the two surfaces of the crystalline lens. In so doing he
followed Samson’s method, and observed the images thrown by a luminous
object, whose rays strike the different refracting surfaces of the eye.
A candle, <span class="smcap lowercase">L</span> (fig. 98), is placed before the
eye, <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>, and throws as in a convex mirror a
straight image of the flame, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> (fig. 99).
The other portion of the light, which has penetrated the pupil, falls
on the crystalline lens, and produces likewise a second straight image,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>. Then the light refracted by the lens
reaches the posterior surface; a portion is reflected on a concave
mirror, and gives the inverted image, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>,
very small and brilliant. M. Cramer observed it through a microscope,
and studied the variations in the size of images when the eye passed
from the observation of adjacent to distant objects. He stated:—</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_104.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 98.—M. Cramer’s experiment.</div>
</div>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_104b.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 99.—Images in the eye.</div>
</div>

<p>1. That the image, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, formed on the surface of the cornea,
remains the same size in both cases; the form of the cornea
therefore remains unaltered.</p>

<p>2. That the image, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, formed on the upper surface of the lens, diminishes
in proportion as the eye is nearer the object; the surface therefore becoming
more and more convex, as the focal distance diminishes—a result indicated
by the theory that it is possible in the vision of near objects to receive the
image on the retina.</p>

<p>3. That the third image, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, produced on the posterior surface of the
lens, remains nearly invariable.</p>

<p>We may confirm Cramer’s statements by an easy experiment. We
place ourselves in front of the eye of someone who looks in turn at two
objects placed on the same black line at unequal distances from him, and
are able to distinguish by the dimension of the images of the candle, which
object it is that he is regarding. M. Helmholtz has carried M. Cramer’s
methods to perfection, and has been able to formulate a complete theory of
all the phenomena of accommodation. The laws of optics show that the
rays emitted by a luminous point may unite at another point by the action
of the refracting surfaces of the eye. Nevertheless, a white light being
composed of rays of diverse refrangibility, particular effects, known under
the name of <em>chromatic aberration</em>, are produced through the decomposition
of light, which we will proceed to study, under M. Helmholtz’s auspices<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
We make a narrow opening in a screen, and fix behind this opening a
violet glass, penetrable only by red and violet rays. We then place a light,
the red rays of which reach the eye of the observer after having passed
through the glass and the opening in the screen. If the eye is adapted to
the red rays, the violet rays will form a circle of diffusion, and a red point
encircled with a violet aureola is seen. The eye may also be brought to a
state of refraction, so that the point of convergence of the violet rays is in
front, and that of the red rays behind the retina, the diameters of the red
and violet circles of diffusion being equal. It is then only that the luminous
point appears monochromatic. When the eye is in this state of refraction,
the simple rays, whose refrangibility is maintained between the red and the
violet rays, unite on the retina.</p>

<p>There is another kind of aberration of luminous rays of one colour
emitted through a hole, which generally only approach approximately to a
mathematical focus, in consequence of the properties of refracting surfaces;
it is called <em>aberration of sphericity</em>. The phenomena are as follows:—</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_105.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 100.</div>
</div>

<p>1. We take for our object a very small luminous point (the hole made by
a pin in some black paper, through which the light passes), and having also
placed before the eye a convex glass, if we are not
near-sighted, we fix it a little beyond the point
of accommodation, so that it produces on the retina
a little circle of diffusion. We then see, instead
of the luminous point, a figure representing from
four to eight irregular rays, which generally differ
with both eyes, and also with different people.
We have given the result of M. Helmholtz’s observations
in fig. 100; <i>a</i> corresponds to the right eye, and <i>b</i> to the left. The
outer edges of the luminous parts of an image, produced in this way by a
white light, are bordered with blue; the edges towards the centre are of a
reddish yellow. The writer adds that the figure appears to him to have
greater length than breadth. If the light is feeble, only the most brilliant
parts of the figure can be seen, and several images of the luminous point
are visible, of which one is generally more brilliant than the others. If, on
the other hand, the light is very intense,—if, for example, the direct light
of the sun passes through a small opening,—the rays mingle with each
other, and are surrounded by aureola of rays, composed of numberless
extremely fine lines, of all colours, possessing a
much larger diameter, and which we distinguish
by the name of the aureola of capillary rays.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_105b.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 101.</div>
</div>

<p>The radiating form of stars, and the distant
light of street-lamps belong to the preceding
phenomena. If the eye is accommodated to a
greater distance than that of the luminous point,—and
for this purpose, if the luminous point itself is distant, we place before
the eye a slightly convex lens,—we see another radiating image appear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
which M. Helmholtz represents thus (fig. 101): at <i>c</i> as it is presented to the
right eye, and at <i>d</i> as seen by the left.</p>

<p>If the pupil is covered on one side, the side opposite to the image of
diffusion disappears; that is to say, that part of the retinal image situated on
the same side as the covered half of the pupil. This figure, then, is formed
by rays which have not yet crossed the axis of the eye. If we place the
luminous point at a distance to which the eye can accommodate itself, we
see, through a moderate light, a small, round, luminous spot, without any
irregularities. If the light, on the contrary, is intense, the image is radiated
in every position of accommodation, and we merely find that on approaching
nearer, the figure which was elongated, answering to a distant accommodation,
gradually diminishes, grows rounder, and gives place to the vertically
elongated figure, which belongs to the accommodation of a nearer point.
When we examine a slender, luminous line, we behold images developed,
which are easily foreseen, if for every point of the line we suppose radiating
images of diffusion, which encroach on each other. The clearest portions of
these images of diffusion mingle together and form distinct lines, which show
multiplied images of the luminous line. Most persons will see two of these
images; some, with the eyes in certain positions, will see five or six.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_106.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 102.</div>
</div>

<p>To show clearly by experiment the connection existing between double
images and radiated images from points, it is sufficient to make in a dark
sheet of paper a small rectilinear slit, and at a little distance
from one end, on a line with the slit, a small round hole, as
shown at <i>a</i> in fig. 102. Looking at it from a distance we
shall see that the double images of the line have exactly the
same distance between them that the most brilliant parts of
the starred figure of diffusion have from the point, and that
the latter are in a line with the first, as will be seen at <i>b</i>
(fig. 102), where in the image of diffusion of the luminous
point, we only see the clearest parts of star <i>a</i> of the figure.</p>

<p>On lighted surfaces, to which the eye is not exactly
accommodated, multiplied images are often remarked through the passage
from light to darkness being made by two or three successive steps.</p>

<p>A series of facts which have been collected under the title of <em>irradiation</em>,
and which show that brightly-lighted surfaces appear larger than they are
in reality, and that the dark surfaces which surround them appear diminished
to a corresponding degree, explains this by the circumstance that the luminous
sensation is not proportional to the intensity of the objective light.
These phenomena affect very various appearances, according to the form of
respective figures; they are generally seen with the greatest ease and intensity
when the eye is not exactly accommodated to the object examined,
either by the eye being too near or too far off, or by using a concave or convex
lens, which prevents the object being seen clearly. Irradiation is not
completely wanting, even when the accommodation is exact, and we notice
it clearly in very luminous objects, above all when they are small; small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
circles of diffusion increase relatively the dimensions of small objects much
more than of large ones, with regard to which, the dimensions of the small
circles of diffusion which the eye furnishes, when properly accommodated,
become insensible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_107.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 103.—Experiment 1.</div>
</div>

<p>1. <em>Luminous surfaces appear larger.</em> We can never judge exactly of
the dimensions of a slit or small hole through which a bright light escapes;
it always appears to us larger than it really is, even with the most exact
accommodation. Similarly, the fixed stars appear in the form of small
luminous surfaces, even when we make use of a glass which allows of perfect
accommodation. If a gridiron with narrow bars—the spaces intervening
being exactly equal to the thickness of the bars—is held over a light surface,
the spaces will always appear wider than the bars. With an inexact accommodation,
these phenomena are still more remarkable. Fig. 103 exhibits
a white square on a black foundation, and a black square on a white foundation.
Although the two squares have exactly the same dimensions, the
white appears larger than the black, unless with an intense light and an
inexact accommodation.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_107b.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 104.—Experiment 2.</div>
</div>

<p>2. <em>Two adjacent luminous surfaces mingle together.</em> If we hold a
fine metallic wire between the eye and the sun, or the light of a powerful
lamp, we shall cease to see it; the lighted surfaces on all sides of the
wire in the visual range pass one into the other, and
become mingled. In objects composed of black and
white squares, like those of a draught-board (fig. 104),
the angles of the white squares join by irradiation,
and separate the black squares.</p>

<p>3. <em>Straight lines appear interrupted.</em> If a ruler
is held between the eye and the light of a bright
lamp or the sun, we perceive a very distinct hollow
on the edge of the ruler in the part corresponding
to the light. When one point of the retina is
affected by a light which undergoes periodical and
regular variations, the duration of the period being sufficiently short, there
results a continuous impression, like that which would be produced if the
light given during each period were distributed in an equal manner through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>out
the whole duration of the period. To verify the truth of this law, we
will make use of some discs, such as that represented in fig. 105. The innermost
circle is half white and half black; the middle circle has two quarters,
or half its periphery, white, and the outer
circle has four eighths’ white, the rest being
black. If such a disc is turned round, its
entire surface will appear grey; only it is
necessary to turn it with sufficient force
to produce a continuous effect. The white
may also be distributed in other ways, and
provided only that on all the circles of the
disc the proportion of the angles covered
with white is the same, they will always
exhibit the same grey colour. Instead of
black and white we may make use of different
colours, and obtain the same resultant colour
from all the circles, when the proportion of
the angles occupied by each of the colours in the different circles is the
same.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_108.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 105.—Disc which appears uniformly grey by reason of its rotation.</div>
</div>

<p>If we paint on a disc a coloured star, which is detached from a foundation
of another colour (fig. 106), during the rapid rotation of the disc the
centre affects the colour of the star; the outer circle assumes that of the
background, and the intermediate parts of the
disc present the continuous series of the resultant
colours. These results are in accordance with
the theory of the mixture of colours.</p>

<div class="figleft" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 106.—Disc with a star painted on the background of another colour.</div>
</div>

<p>Rotative discs, which are so much used in
experiments in optical physiology, were employed
for the first time by Müsschenbroeck;
the most simple is the top. M. Helmholtz
ordinarily uses a brass spinning-top, which fig. 107
represents at a third the natural size. It is set
in motion by the hand, and its quickness may
be increased or moderated at will; but it cannot
be made to spin quicker than six rounds in a
second; this motion will be kept up for three or four minutes. Thus, with
a feeble movement of rotation, a uniform luminous impression can only be
obtained by dividing the disc into four or six sections, on each of which we
repeat the same arrangement of colours, light, and shade. If the number of
repetitions of the design is less, we obtain, with a bright light, a more or less
shot-coloured disc.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_109.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 107.—M. Helmholtz’s top for studying the impression of light on the retina.</div>
</div>

<p>It is easy to place designs on the disc, even when in motion, or to
make any desired modification, by superposing on the first disc another
disc with sectors, of which we can vary the position by slightly touching it,
or even blowing on it, thus producing during the rotation of the disc very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
varied modifications. If, for instance, we place on a disc covered with blue
and red sectors of equal size, a black disc, of which the sectors are alternately
filled in or empty, the disc, as it turns round, will appear blue if the black
sectors of the upper disc exactly cover the [red] sectors of the lower disc; and it
appears red, if, on the contrary, the blue sectors are covered with the black;
while in the intermediate positions we obtain different mixtures of red and
white, and during the rotation of the disc may vary the colour insensibly
by a gentle touch. By dividing the different sectors with broken or curved
lines, instead of straight ones, we can produce an arrangement of coloured
rings of great variety and beauty. To give the top greater speed, we set it
in motion by drawing a string twined round its stem. The simplest method,
as shown in fig. 108, consists in the employment of a handle similar to
that of the German top. It is a hollow cylinder of wood set into a handle
with two circular holes; and at right angles with these is a groove for the
passage of the string. The stem of the top is passed through the holes of
the cylinder, one end of the string is fixed in the small hole in the stem,
and is rolled round by turning the top in the hand. The part of the stem
on which the string is twisted becomes sufficiently thick for the top to
remain suspended to the handle; then holding it a little above the table,
and giving the string a powerful pull, we set the top in motion, and as the
string unrolls it falls on the table, where it will continue its rotation for
some time. The top represented in fig. 109 is constructed so that the discs
may be firmly pressed by the stem, which is necessary in experiments for
demonstrating Newton’s theory of the mingling of colours. We make use
for this purpose of a variety of discs, made of strong paper of different sizes,
having an opening in the centre and a slit, as in fig. 110; each of the discs
is covered uniformly with a single colour; and if two or more are superposed,
with their slits placed one over the other, we obtain sectors, the size
of which we may vary at will, so that we can modify in a continuous
manner the proportions of the colours. The most perfect construction is
that of Busold’s chromatic top (fig. 111), which should only be employed for
very rapid rotations. The disc, which weighs 5 lbs., is made of an alloy
of zinc and lead, about an inch and a quarter in diameter. The brass axis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
terminates at its lower end with a blunt point of untempered steel; the
cylindrical part of the axis is roughened to encourage the adherence of the
string; the axis is placed between the clamps of a vice, and a plate is put
underneath; we then pull the string firmly with the right hand, and when
the top is in motion it is separated from the clamps. By pulling the
string very powerfully it is possible to obtain a speed of sixty turns in a
second, and the movement will be kept up for three quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>Besides tops, we may make use of different kinds of discs, with an
axis rotating between two clamps; they are moved either by a kind of
clock-work, or by the unrolling of a string, like the tops. Generally, however,
these contrivances have this inconvenience, that the discs cannot be
changed without stopping the instrument, and partly taking it to pieces.
On the other hand, we have the advantage of being able to turn them on a
vertical plane, so that we can conveniently carry on our experiments before
a numerous auditory, which is a more difficult matter with tops. Montigny
contrived to obtain the mingling of colours by means of a turning prism,
which he caused to throw its shadow on a white screen. The Thaumatrope
is a small rectangle of cardboard, which is made to rotate on an axis
passing through the centres of the longest sides. We shall describe it at
greater length when we come to consider a new apparatus known under the
name of the <em>Praxinoscope</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_112.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 111.—Busold’s chromatic top.</div>
</div>

<p>More complicated contrivances have also been constructed on the same
principle, by which one may perceive the rotating disc through slits which
turn at the same time. We will now describe the construction of some
discs invented by Plateau under the name of the Phenakistoscope. These
discs are made of strong cardboard, from six to ten inches in diameter
(fig. 112), on which a certain number of figures (eight to twelve) are placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
in circles at an equal distance from each other, presenting the successive phases
of a periodical movement. This disc is placed on another opaque circle of
rather larger diameter, which has on its margin as many openings as the
first disc has figures. The two discs are placed one on the other, and are
fixed in the centre by means of a screw at the anterior extremity of a small
iron axis, the other end being fitted into a handle. To make use of this
contrivance we place ourselves in front of the glass, towards which we turn
the disc with the figures, placing the eye so as to see the figures through
one of the holes of the large disc. Directly the apparatus begins to turn
round, the figures seen in the glass appear to execute the particular movements
which they represent in different positions. Let us designate by
means of the figures 1, 2, 3, the different openings through which the eye
successively looks, and point out by the same numbers the figures in the
radiuses thus numbered. If the experimenter looks in the glass through
opening 1, he will see first figure 1, which appears in the glass to pass before
his eyes; then the rotation of the disc displaces opening 1,
and the cardboard intervenes, until opening 2 appears; then
figure 2 takes the place of figure 1, until it in turn disappears,
and opening 3 presents figure 3 to view. If these figures
were all similar, the spectator would have but a series of
visual impressions, separate but alike, which by a sufficiently
rapid rotation mingle together in one durable impression like a perfectly
immovable object. If, on the contrary, the figures differ slightly from each
other, the luminous sensations will also mingle in a single object, which will
however appear to be modified in a continuous manner, conformably with the
differences of successive images. With a difference of speed, we obtain a
new series of phenomena. A most simple contrivance of this kind is a top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
of C. B. Dancer, of Manchester (fig. 113). It will be seen that the axis
carries another disc, pierced with openings of different shapes, to the edge of
which a thread is attached. This second disc is carried along by the friction
of the axis, but its rotation is less rapid because of the great resistance offered
by the air to the piece of thread which participates in the movement. If
the lower disc has several differently-coloured sectors, they produce a very
motley appearance, which seems to move sometimes by leaps, and sometimes
by continuous motion. We must distinguish between the phenomena of
successive contrast and simultaneous contrast.</p>

</div>

<p>Phenomena of <em>successive contrast</em> develop what are called <em>accidental
images</em>. If we fix our eyes for a considerable time on a coloured object,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
and then suddenly direct them towards a uniform white surface, we experience
the sensation of the object as it is, but it appears coloured with a
complementary tint; that is to say, it has the colour which, superposed on
the genuine tint, we obtain from pure white. Thus a red object produces a
consecutive green object. The experiment can be tried by gazing at the
sun when it is setting, and then directing one’s eyes towards a white wall in
the same direction.</p>

<p>Phenomena of <em>simultaneous contrast</em> arise from the influence exercised
over each other by different shades and colours which we see <em>simultaneously</em>.
That we may be certain that we have really obtained phenomena of this kind,
the experiments must be arranged in such a manner that accidental images are
not produced, and that the part of the retina affected by the sensation of
colour does not receive, even momentarily, a passing image.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_114.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 114.—Disc, which exhibits, when in rotation, a series of concentric rings.</div>
</div>

<p>The phenomena of simultaneous contrast appear with the greatest
clearness with slight differences of colour, and are therefore exactly the
contrary of phenomena of successive contrast, which are favoured by strong
oppositions of colour and light. We can, in general, characterise phenomena
of simultaneous contrast as governed by this law, common to all perceptions
of the senses: <em>the differences clearly perceived appear greater than the differences
equal to them, but perceived with greater difficulty, either because they only
affect the observation in an uncertain manner, or that the memory fails to judge
of them</em>. A man of middle height appears small beside a tall man, because
at the moment it is forcibly impressed on us that there are taller men than
he, and we lose sight of the fact that there are smaller. The same man of
medium height appears tall beside a man of small stature. We can easily
make experiments on simultaneous contrast with a sheet of transparent
paper. We fasten together a sheet of green and a sheet of rose-coloured
paper, so as to obtain a sheet half red and half green. On the line of
separation between the two colours we place a strip of grey paper, and cover
the whole with a sheet of thin letter-paper of the same size. The grey strip
will then appear red at the edge touching the green, and green at the edge
touching the red; the centre presenting an intermediate shade. It presents
a still more decided appearance if the grey strip is perpendicular with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
line of separation of the two colours; the piece of grey then stretching into
the green will present as deep a red as the red foundation on the other side.
If the line of grey colour exactly covers the line of separation between the
two colours, the contrasting colour is more feeble; the edges of the grey
paper then present complementary strips of colour. Similar effects may be
obtained by superposing, in gradually diminishing layers, strips of thin paper,
so as to form successive bands of different thicknesses. If it is then lit
up from behind, the objective intensity is evidently constant through the
extent of each layer; nevertheless every strip appears darker at the edge
touching a more transparent layer, and lighter at the edge in contact with a
thicker layer. The dull tints of China ink, superposed in layers, will produce
a similar effect. The phenomena are produced by means of rotative discs
of most beautiful and delicate gradations of colour. Let us give the sectors
of the disc the form represented by fig. 114, and make them black and
white; and when in rotation we shall see a series of concentric rings of a
shade that becomes darker and darker towards the centre. The angular
surface of the dark portions is constant in each of these rings. The intensity,
therefore, of each ring is uniform during rapid rotation; it is only between
one ring and another that the intensity varies. Each ring also appears
lighter on its inner side when it borders on a darker ring, and darker on its
outer side when in contact with a lighter ring. If the differences of intensity
in the rings are very slight, one can scarcely judge sometimes if the inner
rings are darker than the outer; the eye is only struck by the periodical
alternations of light and shade presented by the edges of the rings. If,
instead of white and black, we take two different colours, each ring will
present two colours on its two edges, although the colour of the rest of the
ring will be uniform. Each of the constituent colours presents itself with
more intensity on that edge of the ring which borders on another ring
containing a smaller quantity of the colour. Thus, if we mix blue and
yellow, and the blue predominates in the exterior and the yellow in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
interior, every ring will appear yellow at its outer, and blue at its inner edge;
and if the colours present together very slight differences, we may fall into
the illusion which causes the differences really existing between the colours
of the different rings to disappear, leaving instead, on a uniformly coloured
background, the contrasting blue and yellow of the edges of the rings. It is
very characteristic that in these cases we do not see the mixed colours, but
seem to see the constituent colours separately, one beside the other, and one
through the other.</p>

<p>All the experiments we have described afford great interest to the
student; they can easily be performed by those of our readers who are
particularly interested in these little-known subjects. Any one may
construct the greater part of the appliances we have enumerated, and others
can be obtained at an optician’s. The discs in particular are extensively
manufactured, and with great success.</p>

<p class="hang">OPTICAL ILLUSIONS—ZOLLNER’S DESIGNS—THE THAUMATROPE—PHENOKISTOSCOPE—THE
ZOOTROPE—THE PRAXINOSCOPE—THE DAZZLING
TOP.</p>


<p>We shall now continue the subject by describing some illusions more
curious still—those of <em>ocular estimation</em>. These illusions depend rather
on the particular properties of the figures we examine, and the greater
part of these phenomena may be placed in that category whose law we have
just formulated: <em>the differences clearly perceived appear greater than the
differences equal to them, but perceived with greater difficulty</em>. Thus a line ——
when divided appears greater than when not divided; the direct perception
of the parts makes us notice the number of the sub-divisions, the size of
which is more perceptible than when the parts are not clearly marked off.
Thus, in fig. 115, we imagine the length <i>ab</i> equals <i>bc</i>, although <i>ab</i> is in
reality longer than <i>bc</i>. In an experiment consisting of dividing a line into
two equal parts, the right eye tends to increase the half on the right, and the
left eye to enlarge that on the left. To arrive at an exact estimate, we turn
over the paper and find the exact centre.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 116.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Illusions of this kind become more striking when the distances to be
compared run in different directions. If we look at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> (fig. 116), which
are perfect squares, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> appears greater in length than width, whilst <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, on the
contrary, appears to have greater width than length. The case is the same
with angles. On looking at fig. 117, angles 1, 2, 3, 4 are straight, and should
appear so when examined. But 1 and 2 appear pointed, and 3 and 4
obtuse. The illusion is still greater if we look at the figure with the right
eye. If, on the contrary, we turn it, so that 2 and 3 are at the bottom, 1
and 2 will appear greatly pointed to the left eye. The divided angles always
appear relatively greater than they would appear without divisions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>The same illusion is presented in a number of examples in the course
of daily life. An empty room appears smaller than a furnished room, and
a wall covered with paperhangings appears larger than a bare wall. It is a
well-known source of amusement to present someone in company with a
hat, and request him to mark on the wall its supposed height from the
ground. The height generally indicated will be a size and a half too large.</p>

<p>We will relate an experience described by Bravais: “When at sea,”
he says, “at a certain distance from a coast which presents many inequalities,
if we attempt to draw the coastline as it presents itself to the eye, we shall
find on verification that the horizontal dimensions have been correctly
sketched at a certain scale, while all the vertical angular objects have been
represented on a scale twice as large. This illusion, which is sure to occur
in estimates of this kind, can be demonstrated by numerous observations.”</p>

<p>M. Helmholtz has also indicated several optical illusions.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 119.</div>
</div></div>

<p>If we examine fig. 118, the continuation of the line <i>a</i> does not
appear to be <i>d</i>,—which it is in reality,—but <i>f</i>, which is a little lower. This
illusion is still more striking when we make the figure on a smaller scale
(fig. 119), as at <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, where the two fine lines are in continuation with each
other, but do not appear to be so, and at <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, where they appear so, but are
not in reality. If we draw the figures as at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> (fig. 118), leaving out the line
<i>d</i>, and look at them from a gradually increasing distance, so that they appear
to diminish, it will be found that the further off the figure is placed, the
more it seems necessary to lower the line <i>f</i> to make it appear a continuation
of <i>a</i>. These effects are produced by irradiation; they can also be produced
by black lines on a white foundation. Near the point of the two acute
angles, the circles of diffusion of the two black lines touch and mutually
reinforce each other; consequently the retinal image of the narrow line
presents its maximum of darkness nearest to the broad line, and appears
to deviate on that side. In figures of this kind, however, executed on a
larger scale, as in fig. 118, irradiation can scarcely be the only cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
illusion. We will continue our exposition as a means of finding an explanation.
In fig. 120, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> present some examples pointed out by Hering;
the straight, parallel lines, <i>a b</i>, and <i>c d</i>, appear to bend outwards at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>,
and inwards at <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>. But the most striking example is that represented by
fig. 121, published by Zollner.</p>

<p>The vertical black strips of this figure are parallel with each other, but
they appear convergent and divergent, and seem constantly turned out of a
vertical position into a direction inverse to that of the oblique lines which
divide them. The separate halves of the oblique lines are displaced respectively,
like the narrow lines in fig. 119. If the figure is turned so that the
broad vertical lines present an inclination of 45° to the horizon, the convergence
appears even more remarkable, whilst we notice less the apparent
deviation of the halves of the small lines, which are then horizontal and
vertical. The direction of the vertical and horizontal lines is less modified
than that of the oblique lines. We may look upon these latter illusions as
fresh examples of the aforesaid rule, according to which acute angles clearly
defined, but of small size, appear, as a rule, relatively larger when we compare
with obtuse or right angles which are undivided; but if the apparent enlargement
of an acute angle shows itself in such a manner that the two sides appear
to diverge, the illusions given in figs. 118, 120, and 121, will be the result.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_118.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 120.—The horizontal lines, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, are strictly parallel; their appearance of deviation is caused
by the oblique lines.</div>
</div>

<p>In fig. 118 the narrow lines appear to turn towards the point where
they penetrate the thick line and disappear, to appear afterwards in continuation
of each other. In fig. 120 the two halves of each of the two straight
lines seem to deviate through the entire length in such a manner that the
acute angles which they form with the oblique lines appear enlarged. The
same effect is shown by the vertical lines of fig. 121.</p>

<p>M. Helmholtz is of opinion (figs. 120, 121) that the law of contrast is
insufficient to entirely explain the phenomena, and believes that the effect is
also caused by the movements of the eye. In fact, the illusions almost entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
disappear, if we fix on a point of the object in order to develop an accidental
image, and when we have obtained one very distinctly, which is quite possible
with Zollner’s design (fig. 121), this image will present not the slightest
trace of illusion. In fig. 118 the displacement of the gaze will exercise no
very decided influence on the strengthening of the illusion; on the contrary,
it disappears when we turn our eyes on the narrow line, <i>ad</i>. On the other
hand, the fixing of the eyes causes the illusion to disappear with relative
facility in fig. 120, and with more difficulty in fig. 121; it will, however,
disappear equally in the latter design, if we fix it immovably, and instead of
considering it as composed of black lines on a white background, we compel
ourselves to picture it as white lines on a black foundation; then the illusion
vanishes. But if we let our eyes wander over the illustration, the illusion
will return in full force. We can indeed succeed in completely destroying
the illusion produced by these designs by covering them with a sheet of
opaque paper, on which we rest the point of a pin. Looking fixedly at the
point, we suddenly draw away the paper, and can then judge if the gaze has
been fixed and steady according to the clearness of the accidental image
which is formed as a result of the experiment.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 122.—Observation of electric spark.</div>
</div>

<p>The light of an electric spark furnishes the surest and simplest means
of counteracting the influence of movements of the eyes, as during the
momentary duration of the spark the eye cannot execute any sensible movement.
For this experiment the present writer has made use of a wooden
box, <span class="smcap lowercase">A B C D</span> (fig. 122), blackened on the inside. Two holes are made for
the eyes on each side of the box, <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>. The observer looks through the
openings, <i>f</i>, and in front of openings, <i>g</i>, the objects are placed; these are
pierced through with a pin, which can be fixed by the eyes in the absence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
of the electric spark, when the box is perfectly dark. The box is open, and
rests on the table, <span class="smcap lowercase">B D</span>, to allow of changing the object. The conducting
wires of electricity are at <i>h</i> and <i>i</i>; in the centre of the box is a strip of
cardboard, white on the side facing the spark, the light of which it shelters
from the eye of the observer and throws back again on the object. With
the electric light the illusion was completely perceptible with fig. 118,
while it disappeared altogether in fig. 120; with fig. 121 it was not
entirely absent, but when it showed itself, it was much more feeble and
doubtful than usual, though the intensity of light was quite sufficient to allow
of the form of the object being very distinctly examined. Thus two different
phenomena have to be explained; first, the feeble illusion which is produced
without the intervention of movements of the eye; and secondly, the strengthening
of the illusion in consequence of these movements. The law of contrast
sufficiently explains the first; that which one perceives most distinctly
with indirect vision is the concordance of directions with dimensions of the
same kind. We perceive more distinctly the difference of direction presented
at their intersection by the two sides of an acute or obtuse angle,
than the deviation that exists between one of the sides and the perpendicular
which we imagine placed on the other side, but which is not marked. By
being distributed on both sides, the apparent enlargement of the angles gives
way to displacements, and changes of direction of the sides. It is difficult
to correct the apparent displacement of the lines when they remain parallel
to their true direction; for this reason, the illusion of the figure is relatively
more inflexible. Changes of direction, on the contrary, are recognised more
easily if we examine the figure attentively, when these changes have the
effect of causing the concordance of the lines (which accord in reality) to
disappear; it is probably because of the difference in aspect of the numerous
oblique lines of figs. 120 and 121 that the concordance of these lines escapes
the observer’s notice. As regards the influence exercised by the motion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the eyes in the apparent direction of the lines, M. Helmholtz, after discussing
the matter very thoroughly, proves the strengthening of the illusion in
Zollner’s illustration to be caused by those motions. It is not now our
intention to follow out the whole of this demonstration; it will be sufficient
to point out to the reader a fruitful force of study, with but little known
results.</p>

<p>The Romans were well acquainted with the influence of oblique lines.
At Pompeii, fresco paintings are to be found, in which the lines are not
parallel, so that they satisfy the eye influenced by adjacent lines. Engravers
in copper-plate have also studied the influence of <em>etchings</em> on the
parallelism of straight lines, and they calculate the effect that they will
produce on the engraving. In some ornamentations in which these results
have not been calculated, it sometimes happens that parallel lines do not
appear parallel because of the influence of other oblique lines, and a disagreeable
effect is produced. A similar result is to be seen at the railway
station at Lyons, the roof of which is covered with inlaid work in <i lang="fr">point de
Hongrie</i>. The wide parallel lines of this ceiling appear to deviate, a result
produced by a series of oblique lines formed by the planks of wood.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 123.—Two sides of a Thaumatrope disc.</div>
</div>

<p>Having given a long account of the result of M. Helmholtz’s labours,
we will pass to the consideration of another kind of experiments, or rather
appliances, based on the illusions of vision, and the persistence of impressions
on the retina.</p>

<p>The Thaumatrope, to which we have already referred, is a plaything of
very ancient origin, based on the principle we have mentioned. It consists
of a cardboard disc, which we put in motion by pulling two cords. On one
side of the disc a cage, <i>a</i>, is portrayed, on the other a bird, <i>b</i> (fig. 123). When
the little contrivance is turned round, the two designs are seen at the same
time, and form but one image—that of a bird in its cage (fig. 124). It is of
course hardly necessary to add that the designs may be varied.</p>

<p>We have already referred to M. Plateau’s rotating disc (the Phenakistoscope).
Through the narrow slits we perceive in succession representations
of different positions of a certain action. The persistence of the luminous
impressions on the retina gives to the eye the sensation of a continuous
image, which seems animated by the same movements as those portrayed
in the different phases (fig. 125).</p>

</div>

<p>The Zootrope (fig. 126) is a perfected specimen of this apparatus. It is
composed of a cylinder of cardboard, turning on a central axis. The cylinder
is pierced with vertical slits at regular intervals, and through which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
spectator can see the designs upon a band of paper adapted to the interior of
the apparatus in rotation. The designs are so executed that they represent
the different times of a movement between two extremes; and in consequence
of the impressions upon the retina the successive phases are mingled, so the
spectator believes he sees, without transition, the entire movement. We
give a few specimens of the pictures for the Zootrope (fig. 127). We have
here an ape leaping over a hedge, a dancing “Punch,” a gendarme pursuing
a thief, a person holding the devil by the tail, a robber coming out of a box,
and a sportsman firing at a bird. The extremes of the movement are right
and left; the intermediary figures make the transitions, and they are usually
equal in number to the slits in the Zootrope. It is not difficult to construct
such an instrument, and better drawings could be made than the specimens
taken at random from a model. The earth might be represented turning in
space, or a fire-engine pumping water could be given, and thus the Zootrope
might be quite a vehicle of instruction as well as of amusement. This instrument
is certainly one of the most curious in the range of optics, and never
fails to excite interest. The ingenious contrivances which have up to the
present time reproduced it, all consist in the employment of narrow slits,
which besides reducing the light to a great extent, and consequently the
light and clearness of the object, require the instrument to be set in rapid
rotation, which greatly exaggerates the rapidity of the movements represented,
and without which the intermissions of the spectacle could not unite
in a continuous sensation.</p>

<p>We present here an apparatus based on a very different optical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
arrangement. In the <em>Praxinoscope</em><a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> (a name given by the inventor, Mr.
Reynaud, to this new apparatus), the substitution of one object for another
is accomplished without interruption in the vision, or solution of continuity,
and consequently without a sensible reduction of light; in a
word, the eye beholds <em>continuously</em> an image which, nevertheless, is incessantly
changing before it. The result was obtained in this manner. Having
sought unsuccessfully by mechanical means to substitute one object for
another without interrupting the continuity of the spectacle, the inventor was
seized with the idea of producing this substitution, not with the objects
themselves, but with their virtual images. He then contrived the arrangement
which we will now describe. A plane mirror, <span class="smcap lowercase">AB</span> (fig. 129), is placed at
a certain distance from an object, <span class="smcap lowercase">CD</span>, and the virtual image will be seen at
<span class="smcap lowercase">C′D′</span>. If we then turn the plane mirror and object towards the point, <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>,
letting <span class="smcap lowercase">BE</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">DF</span> be their new positions, the image will be at <span class="smcap lowercase">C″D″</span>.
<em>Its axis</em>, <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>, <em>will not be displaced</em>. In the positions, <span class="smcap lowercase">AB</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">CD</span>, first occupied
by the plane mirror and the object, we now place another mirror and object.
Let us imagine the eye placed at <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>. Half of the first object will be seen at
<span class="smcap lowercase">OD″</span>, and half of the second at <span class="smcap lowercase">OC′</span>. If we continue the rotation of the
instrument, we shall soon have mirror No. 2 at <span class="smcap lowercase">TT′</span>, and object No. 2 at <span class="smcap lowercase">SS′</span>.
At the same moment the image of object No. 2 will be seen entirely at
<span class="smcap lowercase">C‴D″</span>. Mirror No. 2 and its object will soon after be at <span class="smcap lowercase">BE</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">DF</span>. If we
then imagine another mirror and its corresponding object at <span class="smcap lowercase">AB</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">CD</span>,
the same succession of phenomena will be reproduced. This experiment
therefore shows that a series of objects placed on the perimeter of a polygon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
will be seen successively at the centre, if the plane mirrors are placed on
a concentric polygon, the “apothème” of which will be less by one-half, and
which will be carried on by the same movement. In its practical form,
M. Reynaud’s apparatus consists of a polygonal or simply circular box
(fig. 128), (for the polygon may be replaced by a circle without the principle
or result being changed), in the centre of which is placed a prism of exactly
half a diameter less, the surface of which is covered with plane mirrors. A
strip of cardboard bearing a number of designs of the same object, portrayed
in different phases of action, is placed in the interior of the circular
rim of the box, so that each position corresponds to a plate of the glass
prism. A moderate movement of rotation given to the apparatus, which is
raised on a central pivot, suffices to produce the substitution of the figures,
and the animated object is reflected on the centre of the glass prism with
remarkable brightness, clearness, and delicacy of movement. Constructed
in this manner, the <em>Praxinoscope</em> forms an optical toy both interesting and
amusing. In the evening, a lamp placed on a support <i lang="la">ad hoc</i>, in the centre
of the apparatus, suffices to light it up very clearly, and a number of persons
may conveniently assemble round it, and witness the effects produced.</p>

<p>Besides the attractions offered by the animated scenes of the <em>Praxinoscope</em>,
the apparatus may also be made the object of useful applications in the
study of optics. It permits an object, a drawing, or a colour, to be substituted
instantaneously in experiments on secondary or subjective images, etc.,
on the contrast of colours or the persistence of impressions, etc. We can
also make what is called a <em>synthesis of movements</em> by placing before the
prism a series of diagrams of natural objects by means of photography.</p>

<p>M. Reynaud has already arranged an apparatus which exhibits in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
largest dimensions the animated reflection of the <em>Praxinoscope</em>, and which
lends itself to the demonstration of curious effects before a numerous
auditory. The ingenious inventor has recently contrived also a very curious
improvement in the original apparatus. In the <em>Praxinoscope Theatre</em> he has
succeeded in producing truly ornamental <em>tableaux</em>, as on a small Lilliputian
stage, in the centre of which the principal object moves with startling effect.
To obtain this result, M. Reynaud commences by cutting out in black paper
the different figures, the whole of which will form an object animated by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
rotation given to the <em>Praxinoscope</em>. To supply the decorations, he arranges
on the black foundation the image of an appropriate coloured design by
means of a piece of glass. It is well known that transparent glass possesses
the property of giving a reflection of the objects on the nearest side as well
as on the farthest. We may recall the applications of this optical effect in
theatres, and also in courses of physics, under the title of <em>impalpable spectres</em>.
It is also by reflection on thin, transparent glass, that M. Reynaud produces
the image of the ornamentations in the <em>Praxinoscope Theatre</em>. The
decorations are really placed in the lid, which is held by a hook in a vertical
position, thus forming the front side of the apparatus (fig. 130). In this
side a rectangular opening is made, through which the spectator (using both
eyes) perceives at the same time the animated reflection of the <em>Praxinoscope</em>,
and the immovable image of the decorations reflected in the transparent
glass. The position of the latter and its distance from the coloured decorations
are arranged so that the reflection is thrown behind the moving figure,
which consequently appears in strong relief against the background, the
effect produced being very striking. It is evident that to change the
decorations it is only necessary to place in succession on a slide the different
<em>chromos</em> representing landscapes, buildings, the interior of a circus, etc. It
is easy to choose an arrangement suitable for each of the moving figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
placed in the <em>Praxinoscope</em>. By this clever and entirely novel optical combination,
the mechanism of the contrivance is entirely lost sight of, leaving
only the effect produced by the animated figures, which fulfil their different
movements on the little stage. The <em>Praxinoscope Theatre</em> can also be used as
well in the evening as in the daytime. By daylight, it is sufficient to place
it before a window, and in the evening the same effects may be produced,
perhaps in even a more striking manner, by simply placing a lamp on the
stand, with a small plated reflector, and a lamp-shade. The illusion produced
by this scientific plaything is very complete and curious, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
M. Reynaud cannot be too much commended for so cleverly applying his
knowledge of physics in the construction of an apparatus which is at the
same time both an optical instrument and a charming source of amusement.</p>

<p>Amongst the toys founded upon the persistency of impressions upon
the retina we may instance the “Dazzling Top” (fig. 131). This remarkable
invention is quite worthy of a place in every cabinet, and is an ingenious
specimen of a perfected Helmholtz top. It is a metallic toy put in motion by
means of a cord wound round a groove. The axis is hollow, admits a metallic
stem, and fits into a handle which is held in the hand. The top is placed
upon a little cup in an upright position, and it is then set spinning in the
usual way with the cord. The stem and handle are then withdrawn, and as
the top will continue to spin for a long time, discs and various outline shapes
can be fixed upon it, and various objects will be shadowed thereon. Cups,
bowls, candlesticks, and jugs can be seen plainly revolving as the top carries
the wire representation in outline rapidly past the eyes. Coloured cardboard
can be worked into various patterns, and much amusement will be created
amongst children and young people.</p>

<p class="hang">OPTICAL ILLUSIONS CONTINUED—EXPERIMENTS—THE TALKING HEAD—GHOST
ILLUSIONS.</p>


<p>The enumeration of optical illusions is so considerable that we have no
intention of describing them all, and will merely cite a few other examples.
The following facts have been communicated to us by M. Nachet:—</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_129.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 132.—Hexagonal appearance formed by circles joined together.</div>
</div>

<p>When examining algæ under the microscope, we notice the spaces
which separate the streaks ornamenting the silicious covering of these
various organisms, and it is explained that they are formed by hexagons
visible only when we examine the object with a powerful microscope. “For
a long time,” says M. Nachet, “I occupied myself with the examination of
the hexagonal appearance of the points constituting the streaks. Why should
these hexagons show themselves, and how could they be other than the
visible base of small pyramids piled very closely one on the other; and if
this were the case, why were not the points of the little pyramids visible?
Or, was the structure before me analogous to that of the eyes of insects?
Then the carapace would be but a surface of perforated polygonal openings.
This latter hypothesis was attractive enough, and would have explained
many things; but some careful observations with very powerful object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>-glasses,
quite free from blemishes, had shown me that these hexagons had
round points, contrary to the descriptions of micrographs. These observations,
corroborated by the micrographic photographs of Lackerbauer, the much-regretted
designer, and by Colonels Woodward and Washington, left not the
slightest doubt that it was necessary to discover why the eye persistently
saw hexagons where there were circles. To elucidate this point, it was
necessary to find some means of reproducing artificially what nature had
accomplished with so much precision on the surfaces of algæ. After many
fruitless attempts, I decided on making a
trial of a stereotype plate covered with dots
arranged in quincunxes, very close together”
(figs. 132 and 133). “The result was more
successful than I had hoped; the effect produced
is exactly that of the arrangement of
the so-called hexagons of the most beautiful
of the algæ, the <i>Pleurosigma angulata</i>. If
these stereotypes are examined with one eye
only, we shall be immediately convinced that we have to do with hexagonal
polygons.” It is useless to give any long exposition of a figure so clearly
explanatory; it is simply an effect of the contrast and opposition of the
black and white in the sensation of the retina. This effect is particularly
striking with fig. 134, a negative photograph heliographically engraved
according to fig. 133. In this the white points seem to destroy the black
spaces, and to approach each other tangentially, and the irradiation is so
intense that the white circles appear much larger than the black of fig. 133,
although of the same diameter. There are in these facts many points
which may interest not only students of micrography, but also artists. As
to the algæ, the origin of this investigation, it remains to be discovered if
these circles which cover their silicious carapace are the projection of small
hemispheres, or the section of openings
made in the thick covering. Certain
experiments, however, seem to prove
that they are hemispheres, and the
theory is also confirmed by a microscopic
photograph from Lackerbauer’s
collection, magnified 3,000 diameters,
in which a black central point is seen
in the centre of each circle, a certain
reflection of the luminous source reproduced
in the focus of each of the
small demi-spheres which constitute
the ornament of the algæ. The microscope, which has progressively shown
first the streaks, then the hexagons, and then the round points, will surely
clear up the point some day or other.</p>

<p>Mr. Silvanus P. Thompson, Professor of Physics at University College,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Bristol, has recently presented the French Society of Physical Science with
a curious example of optical illusion, the true cause of which is not clearly
known, but which we may compare with other facts made known some time
ago, of which no precise explanation has been given. Let us first consider in
what the effect discovered by Mr. S. P. Thompson consists, according to the
description that has been given of it by M. C. M. Gariel; the illustrations
here given will also allow of our verifying the truth of the statements.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_131.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 135. and Fig. 136.<br />
Mr. Thompson’s optical illusion. Give a circular movement to these figures,
and the circles will appear to turn round.</div>
</div>

<p>The first illustration consists of a series of concentric circles of about
the width of a millimetre, separated by white intervals of the same size
(fig. 135). These dimensions are not absolute; they vary with the distance,
and may even be a few inches in width if it is desired to show the phenomenon
to a rather numerous auditory. If we hold the design in the hand,
and give it a twirl by a little movement of the wrist, the circle appears to
turn round its centre, and the rotation is in the same direction, and is equally
swift; that is to say, the circle appears to accomplish a complete turn,
whilst the cardboard really accomplishes one in the same direction. For
the second effect we draw a dark circle, in the interior of which are placed
a number of indentations at regular intervals (fig. 136). Operating in
the same manner as described above, this notched wheel appears to turn
round its centre, but this time in a different direction from the real movement.
In this, however, as in the other design, the effect is more satisfactory
if we do not look directly at it; the movements also are particularly
striking in combinations such as that represented in fig. 137, in which the
multiplicity of circles does not allow us to fix one specially. We may add
that the same effects may be obtained with eccentric wheels, or even with
other curves than circles. By means of a photograph on glass, Mr. Thompson
has been able to reflect these designs on a screen where they were obtained
on a large scale; a circular movement was communicated to the photographic
plate, so that the design moved in a circular manner on the screen,
and in this case also there existed the illusion that every circle seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
turning round its centre. And what is the explanation of these curious
effects? Mr. Thompson does not believe (and we share his opinion) that
the faculty possessed by the retina of preserving images during a certain
time (<em>persistence of impressions on the retina</em>) can entirely explain these
phenomena. Without desiring to formulate a decided theory, Mr. Thompson
is of opinion that we may class these facts with others which have been
known for some time, and that perhaps it is necessary to attribute to the
eye some new faculty which may explain the whole at once.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_132.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 137.—Another figure of Mr. Thompson’s. The different circles appear
to turn round if we give the design a rotating movement.</div>
</div>

<p>Brewster and Adams have described phenomena which are equally
curious, the principal of which we will describe, adding also some analogous
investigations due to Mr. Thompson. The result seems to be that there
exists in the eye a badly-defined purpose of nature, which in a certain way
<em>compensates</em> (Brewster) for the real phenomenon, because it has a contrary
effect, which will continue for some time after the cessation of the phenomena,
and which gives by itself a sensation contrary to that which the real
movement would have produced. Thus, after having fixed our eyes for two
or three minutes on a rushing waterfall, if we suddenly turn our glance on
the adjacent rocks, the latter appear to move from top to bottom. It is not
a question here of the effect of the relative movement to be observed on regarding
<em>simultaneously</em> the falling water and the rocks; if one can succeed in
abstracting oneself to such an extent that the water appears motionless, the
rocks appear to take a contrary movement. In the phenomenon we describe
there is no simultaneous comparison; the eyes are turned <em>successively</em> first
on the water, and then on the rocks. In a rapid river, such as the Rhine
above the fall at Schaffhausen, the stream is not equally swift in every part,
and the current is noticeably more rapid in the middle of the river than
near the banks. If we look fixedly at the centre of the stream, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
suddenly turn our eyes towards the banks, it will appear as though the river
were flowing back towards its source. This kind of <em>compensation</em> does not
only produce an apparent displacement, but also changes in size. When
travelling at great speed in a railway train, the objects of the surrounding
country as one flies by them gradually appear smaller and smaller. If, when
this occurs, we suddenly remove our eyes to the interior of the railway
carriage, and fix them on immovable objects, such as the sides of the compartment,
or the faces of our travelling companions, the images on the retina
will really preserve the same size, and yet the objects will appear larger.
Such are some of the interesting facts among those discovered by Mr.
Thompson; and though we do not intend to push the inquiry further, we
think it may not be without interest to describe here another illusion of that
organ whose properties are in every way so curious and remarkable.</p>

</div>

<p>Another experiment to show the existence of impressions received by
the retina can be made with the figure above (138). If the gaze be fixed upon
the dark spot in the centre of the white figure for about half a minute, and
the eyes then directed to the ceiling, or a sheet of white paper, the white
figure will be reproduced <em>in black</em>. This result is based upon the principle
of complementary colours. A red design, for instance, will be reproduced
in green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a dark spot in every human eye—that is, a spot which is
insensible to light. The eye is generally regarded as a perfect instrument,
but it is not yet so by any means. One of our great philosophers remarked
that if an instrument were sent home to him so full of errors he would feel
justified in returning it to the optician. But the eye has its dark place, the
<i lang="la">punctum cæcum</i>, and it can be discovered by covering the left eye with the
hand, and holding the present page at arm’s length with the other. Then
fix the gaze on the small cross in the picture, and bring the book close up.
At a little distance the white ball will disappear from the page (fig. 139).</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_134.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig 140.—An optical illusion.</div>
</div>

<p>The illustration (fig. 140) shows us a very curious optical illusion, and
one very easy to practise. Roll up a sheet of paper, and look through it, as
through a telescope, with the right eye, <em>keeping both eyes open</em>. Then
place the left hand open palm towards you against the roll of paper, you will
then appear to be looking through a hole in your left hand. Sometimes the
effect is produced without holding up the other hand to the roll, as shown in
fig. 140.</p>

<p>Among optical illusions there are a great number that may be produced
by means of mirrors. The divided telescope is an example. The apparatus,
raised on a firm stand, allows of one apparently seeing an object through a
stone or other opaque object, as shown in fig. 141. The illustration shows
the arrangement of the apparatus. The observer, looking through it, plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
perceives the object through the glass; the image is reflected four times
before reaching his eye, by means of small mirrors concealed in the
instrument.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_135.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 141.—A divided telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>Convex or concave mirrors distort images in a singular manner, and
produce very interesting effects. <em>Anamorphoses</em> constitute particular objects
belonging specially to the class of experiments relating to cylindrical mirrors.
They are images made according to determined rules, but so distorted that
when regarding them fixedly we can only distinguish confused strokes.
When they are seen reflected in the curved mirrors, they present, on the
contrary, a perfectly regular appearance. Fig. 142 exhibits an Anamorphosis
made by a cylindrical mirror. It will be seen that the confused image of
the horizontal paper is reflected in the cylindrical mirror, producing the
figure of a juggler. It is easy to contrive similar designs one’s-self; and
comical mirrors may also be employed which produce particular effects of a
no less interesting kind. The next illustration is of a set of figures which in
a cylindrical mirror look like the ten of hearts (fig. 143).</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable applications of mirrors in amusing experiments
is undoubtedly that of the severed and <em>talking head</em>. A few years back
this trick obtained considerable success in Paris and a number of other towns.
The spectators beheld a small space set apart, in which was placed a table
on three legs; on this table was a human head, placed in cloth on a dish.
The head moved its eyes and spoke; it evidently belonged to a man whose
body was completely hidden. The spectators thought they saw an empty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
space beneath the table, but the body of the individual who was really seated
there was concealed by two glasses placed at an inclination of 45° to the
walls on the right and left. The whole was arranged in such a manner that
the reflection of the walls coincided with the visible part of the wall at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
back of the room. The three walls were painted in one colour, and a
subdued light increased the illusion, the effect of which was remarkable
(fig. 144).</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_137.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 144.—The talking head.</div>
</div>

<p>The spectres designed by Robin also attracted considerable public
attention within recent times. They were images formed by the medium of
transparent glass. Glass panes often produce the phenomenon of spectres.
In the evening, when it is dark out of doors, it is easy to prove that the
reflection of objects in a lighted room can be reproduced behind the window
panes by reason of the darkness outside. If we approach the window pane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
we see also the real objects outside, a balcony, tree, etc. These real objects
mingle with the reflected image, and combine to produce very curious effects.
In this way M. Robin has contrived the effects of the theatre. He throws
on the stage the reflection of a person dressed as a Zouave, and he himself,
armed with a sabre, stabs the spectre through the body. A great number
of other singular effects have been obtained in the same manner. Pepper’s
Ghost was managed in this way.</p>

<p>Within recent times, images produced in a similar way have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
utilized to facilitate the study of drawing. A piece of glass is fixed vertically
on a black board (fig. 146). A model to copy from is placed on one side of
the piece of glass, and is arranged so that the visual ray passes obliquely
through the glass, and we perceive the reflection of the design very clearly
on the other side. It is then very easily reproduced with a pencil on a sheet
of white paper by tracing the outlines.</p>

<p>The eye and vision are such important subjects to all of us that we may
be excused for saying something more concerning phenomena connected with
them, and the instruments we use for assisting them. We do not propose
to write a treatise upon the physiology of vision, for we know the image in
the eye is produced physically in the same manner as the image in a camera
obscura. In the eye the sides of the box are represented by the sclerotic
(see chap. x. fig. 95); the dark inner surface has its parallel in the pigment
of the choroid; the opening in the box in the pupil of the eye; the convex
lens in the crystalline and the cornea; and the retina receives the image.
But why we see—beyond the fact that we do see—no one can explain.
Science is dumb on the subject. Thought and consciousness elude our
grasp; and, as Professor Tyndall says on this subject, “we stand face to
face with the incomprehensible.”</p>

<p>But there are many interesting facts connected with our vision which may
be plainly described. Some people are obliged to carry an object (or a book)
to within ten inches of the eye to see it distinctly; and a person who does not
possess convergent power of the eye will have to move it farther off, or use
convex glasses; while a “near-sighted” person, whose eyes are too quickly
convergent, will use concave glasses to bring the object near to the eye.</p>

<p>There is but one small place in the retina of the eye which admits of
perfect vision. This, the most sensitive portion, is called the “yellow spot,”
and vision becomes more and more indistinct from this point towards the
circumference. This can be proved by any one; for in reading we are
obliged to carry our eyes from word to word, and backwards and forwards
along the lines of print. Another very important element in our vision is the
contraction and enlargement of the iris around the pupil. In cases where
strong light would only dazzle us the iris expands, and the pupil is contracted
to a sufficient size to accommodate our vision. At night, or in a darkened
room, the pupil is enlarged. This change will account for our not being immediately
able to see objects when we have passed from darkness to great light,
or <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>. The iris must have time to accommodate itself to the light.</p>

<p>Now, outside the small space of perfect vision above mentioned, there is
a circle of considerable extent, called the “field of vision.” In man this field,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
when the eyes are fixed, subtends an angle of about 180°, because beyond
that the rays cannot enter the pupil of the eye. But in the lower animals,
the fish and birds,—notably the ostrich,—the field of vision is much more
extensive, because the pupils are more prominent, or the eyes are set more
towards the sides of the head. The ostrich can see behind him, and fish
can see in any direction without apparent limit. Man can only see indistinctly;
and though he can move his eyes rapidly, he can see distinctly but
a small portion of any object at a time, yet he sees with both eyes simultaneously
a single object, because the two lines of vision unite at a single
point, and as the two images cover each other we perceive only one image.
Beyond or within this point of meeting the vision is indistinct, but the angle
of convergence is always varied according to the distance of the object. If we
hold up a penholder in front of us, and in a line with any other defined object,—say
an ink-bottle,—we can see the penholder distinctly, and the ink-bottle
indistinctly, as <em>two</em> images. If we then look at the ink-bottle we shall see it
single, while the penholder will appear double, but with imperfect outlines.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Again, if we look at a box both eyes will see it equally well, but the right
eye will see a little more on its right side, and the left eye on the left. It is
on this principle that the Stereoscope is constructed. Sir Charles Wheatstone
was the inventor, and the instrument may be thus described:—Two pictures
are taken by photography—one as the landscape is seen by the right eye,
the other as it is viewed by the left; the points of view thus differing
slightly. When both eyes are simultaneously applied to the instrument the
view is seen exactly as it would appear to the beholder at the actual place
it represents. The views are taken singly; one side at one time, and another
after, as in the camera (fig. 148). A is the first view; B is kept dark; C is the
shutter for A. There are <em>Reflecting</em> and <em>Refracting</em> Stereoscopes. In the
former a mirror reflects the image into each eye; in the latter the views are
pasted on a card, side by side, and looked at through prismatic lenses. The
principles of <em>Binocular Vision</em> have been applied to the Microscope.</p>

<p>In foregoing chapters we have given many examples with diagrams of the
temporary impressions made upon the retina of the eye. It is a fact that a
wheel revolving at a great rate will appear to be standing still when suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
illuminated by a flash of lightning, because the eye has not time to take in
the motion in the instant of time, for the spokes of the wheel are not moving
fast enough to convey the impression of motion in that half second to the
eye; yet the perfect outline of the wheel is distinctly visible.</p>

<p>Indeed, distinct vision can be exercised in a very small fraction of a
second. It was calculated by Professor Rood, and proved by experiment,
that <em>forty billionths</em> of a second is sufficient time for the eye to distinguish
letters on a printed page. It this instance the illuminating power was an
electric spark from a Leyden Jar.</p>

<p>We have remarked upon the distinctness with which we can see an object
when we direct our gaze upon it, and this appears a self-evident proposition;
but have any of our readers remarked the curious fact that when they want
to see a faint and particular star in the sky it will at once disappear when
they gaze at it? The best way to see such very faint orbs as this is to <em>look
away from them</em>,—a little to one side or the other,—and then the tiny point
will become visible again to the eye. There is also a degree of phosphorescence
in the eye, which any one who receives a blow upon that organ will
readily admit. Even a simple pressure on the closed lid will show us a circle
of light and “colours like a peacock’s tail,” as the great Newton expressed
it. There are many occasions in which light is perceived in the eye—generally
the result of muscular action; and the Irish term to “knock fire out of my
eye” is founded upon philosophical facts.</p>

<p>We are many of us aware of “spots” on our eyes when our digestion
is out of order, and the inability of the eye to see figures distinctly in a
faint light—within a proper seeing distance, too—has often given rise to the
“ghost.” These shadowy forms are nothing more than affections of the eye,
and, as well remarked in Brewster’s Letters on Natural Magic, “are always
<em>white</em> because no other colour can be seen.” The light is not sufficiently
strong to enable the person to see distinctly; and as the eye passes from side
to side, and strives to take in the figure, it naturally seems shadowy and
indistinct, and appears to move as our eyes move. “When the eye dimly
descries an inanimate object whose different parts reflect different degrees
of light, its brighter parts may enable the spectator to keep up a continued
view of it; but the disappearance and reappearance of its fainter parts, and
the change of shape which ensues, will necessarily give it the semblance of
a living form; and if it occupies a position which is unapproachable, and
where animate objects cannot find their way, the mind will soon transfer to
it a supernatural existence. In like manner a human figure shadowed forth
in a feeble twilight may undergo similar changes, and after being distinctly
seen while it is in a situation favourable for receiving and reflecting light,
it may suddenly disappear in a position before and within the reach of the
observer’s eye; and if this evanescence takes place in a path or roadway
where there is no sideway by which the figure could escape, it is not easy
for an ordinary mind to efface the impression which it cannot fail to receive.”
This will account for many so-called “ghosts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Accidental colours, or ocular spectra, are, so to speak, illusions, and
differently-coloured objects will, when our gaze is turned from them, give us
different “spectra” or images. For instance, a violet object will, when we
turn to a sheet of white paper, give us a yellow “spectrum”; orange will
be blue; black and white will change respectively; red will become a blue-green.
From a very strong white light the accidental colours will vary.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_143.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 149.—The Solar Spectrum.</div>
</div>

<p>The Solar Spectrum is the name given to the coloured band formed by
the decomposition of a beam of light into its elementary colours, of
which there are seven. This is an easy experiment. A ray of light can
be admitted into a darkened room through a hole in the shutter, and
thus admitted will produce a white spot on the screen opposite, as at
<i>g</i> in the diagram (fig. 149). If we interpose a prism—a triangular
piece of glass—the “drop” of a chandelier will do—we cause it to
diverge from its direct line, and it will produce a longer streak of
light lower down. This streak will exhibit the prismatic colours, or
the “colours of the rainbow”; viz., red (at the top), orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo (blue), and violet last. These are the colours
of the Solar Spectrum. The white light is thus decomposed, and it is
called mixed light, because of the seven rays of which it is composed.
These rays can be again collected and returned to the white light by
means of a convex lens.</p>

<p>“White light,” said Sir Isaac Newton, “is composed of rays differently
refrangible,” and as we can obtain the colours of the rainbow from white
light, we can, by painting them on a circular plate and turning it rapidly
round, make the plate appear white. Thus we can prove that the seven
colours make “white” when intermingled. But Newton (1675) did not
arrive at the great importance of his experiment. He made a round hole
in the shutter, and found that the various colours overlapped each other.
But, in 1802, Dr. Wollaston improved on this experiment, and by admitting
the light through a tiny slit in the wood, procured an almost perfect spectrum
of “simple” colours, each one perfectly distinct and divided by black lines.</p>

<p>But twelve years later, Professor Fraunhofer made a chart of these lines,
which are still known by his name. Only, instead of the 576 he discovered,
there are now thousands known to us! To Fraunhofer’s telescope Mr.
Simms added a collimating lens, and so the Spectroscope was begun; and
now we use a number of prisms and almost perfect instruments, dispersing
the light through each. We have here an illustration of a simple Spectroscope,
which is much used for chemical analysis (fig. 150).</p>

<p>In the spectrum we have long and short waves of light, as we have long
and short (high and low) waves in music, called notes. The long or low
notes are as the red rays, the high notes as the blue waves of light. (Here
we have another instance of the similarity between light and sound.) But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
suppose we shut out the daylight and substitute an artificial light. If we
use a lamp burning alcohol with salt (chloride of sodium), the spectrum will
only consist of two yellow bands, all the other colours being absent. With
lithium we obtain only two, one orange and one red. From this we deduce
the fact that different substances when burning produce different spectra;
and although a solid may (and platinum will) give all seven colours in its
spectrum, others, as we have seen, will only give us a few, the portion of
the spectrum between the colours being black. Others are continuous, and
transversed by “lines” or narrow spaces devoid of light; such is the spectrum
of the sun, and by careful and attentive calculation and observation we can
get an approximate idea of the matter surrounding the heavenly bodies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_144.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 150.—The Spectroscope.</div>
</div>

<p>We have said there are lines crossing the spectrum transversely; these
are called Fraunhofer’s lines, after the philosopher who studied them; they
were, however, discovered by Wollaston. These lines are caused by light
from the lower portion of the sun passing through the metallic vapours
surrounding the orb in a state of incandescence, such as sodium, iron, etc.
One of Fraunhofer’s lines, a black double line known as <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span> in the yellow
portion of the spectrum, was known to occupy the same place as a certain
<em>luminous</em> line produced by sodium compounds in the flame of a spirit lamp.
This gave rise to much consideration, and at length Kirchkoff proved that
the sodium vapour which gives out yellow light can also absorb that light;
and this fact, viz., that every substance, which at a <em>certain temperature</em> emits
light of a certain refrangibility, possesses at that temperature the power to
absorb that same light. So the black lines are now considered the reversal
of luminous lines due to the incandescent vapours by which the sun is
surrounded. Thus the presence of an element can be found from black or
luminous lines, so the existence of terrestrial elements in celestial bodies has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
been discovered by means of preparing charts of the lines of the terrestrial
elements, and comparing them with the lines of stella <em>spectra</em>.</p>

<p>We have supposed the beam of light to enter through a slit in the
shutter, and fall upon a screen or sheet. The solar spectrum shown by the
passage of the beam through a prism is roughly as below—</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_145.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 151.—Example of the Spectrum.</div>
</div>

<p>Fraunhofer substituted a telescope for the lens and the screen, and
called his instrument a <span class="smcap">Spectroscope</span>. He then observed the lines, which
are always in the same position in the solar spectrum. The principal of
them he designated as <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">G</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>. The first three are in the red
part of the spectrum; one in the yellow, then one in the green; <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span> comes
between green and blue, <span class="smcap lowercase">G</span> in the indigo-blue, and <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span> in the violet. But
these by no means exhaust the lines now visible. Year by year the study
of Spectrum Analysis has been perfected more and more, and now we are
aware of more than three thousand “lines” existing in the solar spectrum.
The spectra of the moon and planets contain similar dark lines as are seen
in the solar spectrum, but the fixed stars show different lines. By spectrum
analysis we know the various constituents of the sun’s atmosphere, and we
can fix the result of our observations made by means of the Spectroscope
in the photographic camera. By the more recent discoveries great studies
have been made in “solar chemistry.”</p>

<p>What can we do with the Spectroscope, or rather, What can we <em>not</em> do?
By Spectroscopy we can find out, and have already far advanced upon our
path of discovery, “the measure of the sun’s rotation, the speed and direction
of the fierce tornados which sweep over its surface, and give rise to the
‘maelstroms’ we term ‘sunspots,’ and the mighty alps of glowing gas
that shoot far beyond the visible orb, ever changing their form and size;
even the temperature and pressure of the several layers and their fluctuations
are in process of being defined and determined.” This is what science is
doing for us, and when we have actually succeeded in ascertaining the
weather at various depths in the atmosphere of the sun, we shall be able to
predict our own, which depends so much upon the sun. Last year (1880)
Professor Adams, in his address to the British Association, showed that
magnetic disturbances, identical in kind, took place at places widely apart
simultaneously. He argues that the cause of these identical disturbances
must be far removed from the earth.</p>

<p>“If,” he says, “we imagine the masses of iron, nickel, and magnesium
in the sun to retain even in a slight degree their magnetic power in a
gaseous state, we have a sufficient cause for all our magnetic changes. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
know that masses of metal are ever boiling up from the lower and hotter
levels of the sun’s atmosphere to the cooler upper regions, where they must
again form clouds to throw out their light and heat, and to absorb the light
and heat coming from the hotter lower regions; then they become condensed,
and are drawn back again towards the body of the sun, so forming
those remarkable dark spaces or sunspots by their down rush to their former
levels. In these vast changes we have abundant cause for those magnetic
changes which we observe at the same instant at distant points on the
surface of the earth.” So we are indebted to the Spectroscope for many
wonderful results—the constitution of the stars, whether they are solid or
gaseous, and many other wonders.</p>

<p>The manner in which we have arrived at these startling conclusions is
not difficult to be understood, but some little explanation will be necessary.</p>

<p>The existence of dark lines in the solar spectrum proves that certain
rays of solar light are absent, or that there is less light. When we look
through the prism we perceive the spaces or lines, and we can produce these
ourselves by interposing some substance between the slit in the shutter
before mentioned and the prism. The vapour of sodium will answer our
purpose, and we shall find a dark line in the spectrum, the bright lines being
absorbed by the vapour. We can subject a substance to any temperature
we please, and into any condition—solid, liquid, or gaseous; we can also
send the light the substance may give out through certain media, and we can
photograph the spectrum given out under all conditions. <em>The distance of the
source of the light makes no difference.</em> So whether it be the sun, or a far-distant
star, we can tell by the light sent to us what the physical condition
of the star may be. It was discovered in 1864 that the same metallic body
may give different <em>spectra</em>; for instance, the spectrum might be a band of
light,—like the rainbow,—or a few isolated colours; or again, certain
detached lines in groups. The brightness of the spectrum lines will change
with the depth of the light-giving source, or matter which produces it.</p>

<p>We have become aware by means of the Spectroscope that numerous
metals known to us on earth are in combustion in the sun, and new ones
have thus been discovered. In the immense ocean of gas surrounding the
sun there are twenty-two elements as given by Mr. Lockyer, including iron,
sodium, nickel, barium, zinc, lead, calcium, cobalt, hydrogen, potassium,
cadmium, uranium, strontium, etc. Not only is the visible spectrum capable
of minute examination, but, as in the case of the <em>heat spectrum</em> already
mentioned when speaking of Calorescence, the light spectrum has been traced
and photographed far beyond the dark space after the blue and violet rays,
seven times longer than the visible solar spectrum—a spectrum of light
invisible to our finite vision. Although a telescope has been invented for
the examination of these “ultra violet” rays, no human eye can see them.
But—and here science comes in—when a photographic plate is put in
place of the eye, the tiniest star can be seen and defined. Even the
Spectroscope at length fails, because light at such limits has been held to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
be “too coarse-grained for our purposes”! “Light,” says a writer on this
subject “we can then no longer regard as made of smooth rays; we have
to take into account—and to our annoyance—the fact that its ‘long levelled
rules’ are rippled, and its texture, as it were, loose woven”!</p>

<p>Twenty years ago Professors Kirchkoff and Bunsen applied Fraunhofer’s
method to the examination of coloured flames of various substances, and
since then we have been continually investigating the subject; yet much
remains to be learnt of Spectrum Analysis, and Spectroscopy has still much
to reveal. From Newton’s time to the present our scientists have been
slowly but surely examining with the Spectroscope the composition of
<em>spectra</em>, and the Spectroscope is now the greatest assistant we possess.</p>

<p>“Spectrum Analysis, then, teaches us the great fact that solids and
liquids give out continuous spectra, and vapours and gases give out discontinuous
spectra instead of an unbroken light” (Lockyer). We have
found out that the sunlight and moonlight are identical, that the moon
gives us spectrum like a reflection of the former, but has no atmosphere,
and that comets are but gases or vapours. The most minute particles of
a grain of any substance can be detected to the millionth fraction. The
1/1000 of a grain of blood can be very readily distinguished in a stain after
years have passed. The very year of a certain vintage of wine has been
told by means of “absorption,” or the action of different bodies on light in
the spectrum. It is now easy, “by means of the absorption of different
vapours and different substances held in solution, to determine not only what
the absorbers really are, but also to detect a minute quantity.” The application
of this theory is due to Dr. Gladstone, who used hollow prisms filled
with certain substances, and so thickened the “absorption lines.” By these
lines, or bands, with the aid of the Spectrum Microscope, most wonderful
discoveries have been made, and will continue to be made. We will close
this portion of the subject with a brief description of the Spectroscope in
principle.</p>

<p>The instrument consists of two telescopes arranged with two object-glasses
on a stand (fig. 150). A narrow slit is put in place of the eye-piece
of one, the arrangement admitting of the slit being made smaller or larger
by means of screws. The glass to which the slit is attached is called the
collimating lens. The light, at the end of the slit seen from the other
telescope, being separated by the prisms between the two telescopes, will
produce the spectrum. The Spectroscope is enclosed, so that no exterior
light shall interfere with the spectra the student wishes to observe. This
merely indicates the principle, not the details, of the Spectroscope, which
vary in different instruments.</p>

<p>We may now pass from the Spectroscope to the Telescope and the
Microscope, instruments to which we are most largely indebted for our
knowledge of our surroundings in earth, air, and water.</p>

<p>The word Telescope is derived from the Greek <i lang="el">tele</i>, far, and <i lang="el">skopein</i>, to
see; and the instrument is based upon the property possessed by a convex lens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
or concave mirror, of converging to a focus the rays of light falling on it from
any object, and at that point or focus forming an image of the object.
The following diagram will illustrate this. Let <span class="smcap lowercase">VW</span> be a lens, and <span class="smcap lowercase">AB</span>
an object between the glass, and <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span> the focus. The ray, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span><i>c</i>, is so refracted
as to appear to come from <i>a</i>. The ray from <i>b</i> likewise appears in a similar
way, and a magnified image, <i>ab</i>, is the result (fig. 152).</p>

<p>The ordinary Telescope consists of an object-glass and an eye-lens, with
two intermediates to bring the object into an erect position. A lens brings
it near to us, and a magnifier enlarges it for inspection. We will now give
a short history of the Telescope and its improved construction.</p>

<p>Roger Bacon was supposed to have had some knowledge of the Telescope,
for in 1551 it was written: “Great talke there is of a glass he made
at Oxford, in which men see things that were don.” But a little later,
Baptista Porta found out the power of the convex lens to bring objects
“nearer.” It was, however, according to the old tale, quite by an accident
that the Telescope was discovered about the year 1608.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_150.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 152.—Converging rays to a focus.</div>
</div>

<p>In Middleburg, in Holland, lived a spectacle-maker named Zachary
Jansen, and his sons, when playing with the lenses in the shop, happened
to fix two of them at the proper distance, and then to look through both.
To the astonishment of the boys, they perceived an inverted image of the
church weathercock much nearer and much larger than usual. They at
once told their father what they had seen. He fixed the glasses in a tube,
and having satisfied himself that his sons were correct, thought little more
about the matter. This is the story as told, but there is little doubt that
for the first Telescope the world was indebted either to Hans Lippersheim
or Joseph Adriansz, the former a spectacle-maker of Middleburg; and in
October 1608, Lippersheim presented to the Government three instruments,
with which he “could see things at a distance.” Jansen came after this.
The report of the invention soon spread, and Galileo, who was then in
Venice, eagerly seized upon the idea, and returning to Padua with some
lenses, he managed to construct a telescope, and began to study the heavens.
This was in 1609. <em>Galileo’s Tube</em> became celebrated, and all the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
telescopes were made with the concave eye-lens. Rheita, a monk, made a
binocular telescope, as now used in our opera- and field-glasses approximately.</p>

<p>But the prismatic colours which showed themselves in the early telescopes
were not got rid of, nor was it till 1729 that Hall, by studying the
mechanism of the eye, managed a combination of lenses free from colour.
Ten years before (in 1718) Hadley had established the Reflector Telescope;
Herschel made his celebrated forty-foot “reflector” in 1789.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_149a.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 153.—The Microscope.</div>
</div>

<p>However, to resume. In 1747, Euler declared
that it was quite possible to construct an arrangement
of lenses so as to obtain a colourless image,
but he was at first challenged by John Dollond.
The latter, however, was afterwards induced to
make experiments with prisms of crown and flint
glass. He then tried lenses, and with a concave
lens of flint, and a convex lens of crown, he
corrected the colours. The question of proper
curvature was finally settled, and the “Achromatic”
Telescope became an accomplished fact.</p>

<p>There are two classes of Telescopes—the
reflecting and refracting. Lord Rosse’s is an
instance of the former. Mr. Grubb’s immense
instrument in Dublin is a refractor.</p>

<p>The Microscope has been also attributed to
Zacharias Jansen, and Drebbel, in 1619, possessed the instrument in London,
but it was of little or no use. The lens invented by Hall, as already
mentioned, gave an impetus to the Microscope. In the simple Microscope
the objects are seen directly through the lens or lenses acting as one. The
compound instrument is composed of two lenses (or a number formed to do
duty as two), an eye-lens, and an object-lens. Between these is a “stop” to
restrain all light, except what is necessary to view the object distinctly.
The large glass near the object bends the rays
on to the eyeglass, and a perfect magnified
image is perceived. We annex diagrams,
from which the construction will be readily
understood.</p>

<div class="figright" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 154.—Image on the Retina.</div>
</div>

<p>We have in the previous chapter mentioned
the effect of light upon the eye and
its direction, and when an object is placed
very near the eye we know it cannot be
distinctly seen; a magnified image is thrown
upon the retina, and the divergency of the rays prevents a clear image
being perceived. But if a small lens of a short “focal length” be placed
in front of the eye, having <span class="smcap lowercase">PQ</span> for its focus, the rays of light will be parallel,
or very nearly so, and will as such produce “distinct vision,” and the image
will be magnified at <i>pq</i>. In the Compound Refracting Microscope, <span class="smcap lowercase">BAB</span> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the convex lens, near which an object, <span class="smcap lowercase">PQ</span>, is placed a little beyond its focal
length. An inverted image, <i>pq</i>, will then be formed. This image is produced
in the convex lens, <i>bab′</i>, and when the rays are
reflected out they are parallel, and are distinctly seen. So
the eye of the observer at the point E will see a magnified
image of the object at PQ brought up to <i>pq</i> (fig. 155).</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton suggested the Reflecting Microscope,
and Dr. Wollaston and Sir David Brewster improved the
instrument called the “Periscopic Microscope,” in which
two hemispherical lenses were cemented together by the
plane surfaces, and having a “stop” between them to limit
the aperture. Then
the “Achromatic” instrument
came into
use, and since then
the Microscope has
gradually attained
perfection.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 156.—Concave lens.</div>
</div>

<p>We have so frequently
mentioned
lenses that it may be as well to say something about
them. Lenses may be spherical, double-convex, plane-convex,
plane-concave, double-concave, and concave-convex.
Convex lenses bring the parallel lines which strike them to
a focus, as we see in the “burning-glass.” The concave or hollow lens appears
as in fig. 156. The rays that follow it parallel to its axis are refracted, and
as if they came from a point F in the diagram. But converging rays falling
on it emerge in a parallel direction as above, or diverge as in fig. 158.</p>

<p>The use of spectacles to long or short-sighted people is a necessity,
and the lenses used vary. The eye has usually the capacity of suiting
itself to viewing objects—its accommodation,
as it is termed—near
or far. But when the forepart
of the eye is curved, and
cannot adapt itself to distant
objects, the person is said to be
short-sighted. In long sight the
axis of the eyeball is too short,
and the focus falls beyond the
retina; in short sight it is too
long. In the diagrams herewith
fig. 159 shows by the dotted
lines the position of the retina in
long sight, and fig. 160 in short sight, the clear lines showing in each
case the perfectly-formed eye. For long sight and old sight the double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>-convex
glass is used, for short sight the double-concave (fig. 162). We
know the burning-glass gives us a small image of the sun as it converges
the rays to its focus. But lenses will do more than this, and in the
<span class="smcap">Photographic Camera</span> we find great interest and amusement.</p>

<p>Photography (or writing by light) depends upon the property which
certain preparations possess of being blackened by exposure to light while
in contact with matter. By an achromatic arrangement of lenses the
camera gives us a representation of the desired object Fig. 163 shows the
image on the plate, and figs. 164 and 165 the arrangement of lenses.</p>

<p>To Porta, the Neapolitan physician, whose name we have already mentioned
more than once, is due the first idea of the Photographic Camera.
He found that if light was admitted through a small aperture, objects from
which rays reached the hole would be reflected on the wall like a picture.
To this fact we are indebted for the <span class="smcap">Camera Obscura</span>, which receives the
picture upon a plane surface by an arrangement of lenses. In fact, Porta
nearly arrived at the Daguerreotype process. He thought he could teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
people to draw by following the focussed picture with a crayon, but he
could not conquer the aërial perspective.</p>

<p>So the camera languished till 1820, when Wedgwood and Sir
Humphrey Davy attempted to obtain some views with nitrate of silver,
but they became obliterated when exposed to the daylight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_152.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 163.—The Camera.</div>
</div>

<p>As early as 1814, however, M. Niepce had made a series of experiments
in photography, and subsequently having heard that M. Daguerre
was turning his attention to the same subject, he communicated with him.
In 1827 a paper was read before the Royal Society, and in 1829 a partnership
deed was drawn up between Daguerre and Niepce for “copying
engravings by photography.” Daguerre worked hard, and at length succeeded
in obtaining a picture by a long process, to which, perhaps, some of
our readers are indebted for their likenesses forty years ago. By means of
iodine evaporated on a metal plate covered with “gold-yellow,” and exposing
the plate then in a second box to mercurial vapour, he marked the image
in the camera, and then he immersed the plate in hyposulphate of soda,
and was able to expose the image obtained to daylight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_152b.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 164.      Arrangement of lenses      Fig. 165.</div>
</div>

<p>But the mode now in use is the “collodion” process. We have all
seen the photographer pouring the iodized collodion on the plate, and letting
the superfluous liquid drain from a corner of the glass. When it is dry the
glass-plate is dipped into a solution of nitrate of silver, and then in a few
minutes the glass is ready. The focus is then arranged, and the prepared
plate conveyed in a special slide—to keep it from the light—to the camera.
When the “patient” is ready, the covering of the lens is removed, and the
light works the image into the sensitive plate. The impression is then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
“brought up,” and when developed is washed in water, and after by a
solution which dissolves all the silver from the parts not darkened by the
light. Thus the negative is obtained and printed from in the usual manner.</p>

<p>Instantaneous photography is now practised with great success. An
express train, or the movements of a horse at full speed, can thus be taken
in a second or less. These results are obtained by using prepared plates,
and the “emulsion process,” as it is called, succeeds admirably. The mode
of preparation is given in a late work upon the subject, and the photographic
plates may also be obtained ready for use. Gelatine and water,
mixed with bromide of ammonium, nitrate of silver, and carbonate of
ammonium, mixed with certain proportions of water, form the “emulsion.”
We need not go into all the details here. Information can easily be
obtained from published works, and as the plates can be purchased by
amateurs, they will find that the best way.</p>

<p>Aside from the art interest in the new plates is quite another, that
springs from the fact that it is now possible to take pictures of men,
animals, and machinery in rapid motion, thus enabling us to view them in
a way that would be impossible with the unaided eye. The first experiments
in this direction were applied to the movements of a horse moving at
full speed. The pictures, taken in series, showed that he performed muscular
actions that were not before comprehended or even imagined. These
pictures at the time attracted great attention, and instantaneous pictures
have been since taken of dancers in a ball-room, of vessels and steam-boats
in rapid movement, of all kinds of animals in motion, and of machinery in
operation. As the pictures represent the movements at one instant of time,
they give, as it were, a fixed view of a motion, precisely as if it were suddenly
arrested in full action. In the case of animals, the motions of the
nostrils are represented in the most singular manner, and the spokes of a
steam-boat’s paddle-wheel are shown apparently perfectly still while the
spray and waves appear in active motion, or, rather, as they would look if
they could be instantly frozen. It is clear the new process and pictures will
open a wide and instructive field in art and in the study of mechanical
action.</p>

<p>While on the subject of Photography we may mention a very ingenious
little apparatus called a <span class="smcap">Scenograph</span>, the invention of Dr. Candize. It is
really a pocket-camera, and is so easily manipulated that it will be found
a most pleasant and useful holiday companion. Any one may obtain good
results with it, and friends of ours have had occasion to put it in practice
during a series of excursions, when it was found to answer in every instance.</p>

<p>The Scenograph is something like a common Stereoscope in outward
appearance, and would, perhaps, be at first regarded as a mere toy, did not
a more intimate acquaintance prove it a great acquisition, particularly to
explorers and tourists. The tripod stand which supports the apparatus is,
when not in actual use in that capacity, a very excellent walking-stick, in
which the two other “legs” are carried. The instrument, as will be per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>ceived
from the illustration (fig. 166), is very handy. It produces pictures
about the “cabinet” size, and the whole is so arranged that it can be
packed and carried in the pocket with ease.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_154.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 166.—The Scenograph.</div>
</div>
<p>Photography, as a rule, necessitates a dark room or cabinet, and many
preparations as we all know—a “messing” about with chemicals and considerable
practice before we can become proficient; so it is not surprising
that few amateurs take to it—they prefer to purchase the pictures. But in
the new apparatus of which we are speaking, the glass plates are already
prepared to receive the image. It is not at all necessary for the operator
to stain his fingers and knuckles and nails with nitrate of silver, or any
other “chemicals” whatever. He just inserts the plate in the Scenograph,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and then his apparatus being steadily set up, he removes the covering from
the lens. To develop the image (in the dusk of the evening or by candle-light)
it is necessary to put some drops of ammonia in a saucer, breathe
upon the plate so as to soften the collodion, and hold it above the ammonia,
and then, under the influence of the vapour, the picture will appear. After
this simple operation the picture will be found fixed for a lengthened period—practically
indefinitely. Thus on the return of the pedestrian he can
reproduce, at small expense, a whole series of little pictures faithfully representing
his holiday tour. The illustration shows a small apparatus by
which on thin plates small photographs can be taken and fixed till it is
found desirable to enlarge them.</p>

<p>The <em>Photophone</em>, one of the most recent contributions to science, is
an instrument which, in combination with the telephone principle, makes it
possible to convey sounds by means of a ray of light, and by means of a
quivering beam “to produce articulate speech at a distance. The success
of the Photophone depends upon a rare element, selenium, which has its
“electrical resistance” affected by light. Professor Adams demonstrated
that the resistance of selenium was reduced just in proportion as the
intensity of the light which was acting upon it. Here was the key to the
Photophone as thought out by Professor Bell. He fancied that he might
by means of his telephone produce sound if he could vary the intensity of
the beam of light upon the selenium, which he connected with his telephone
and battery.</p>

<p>The Photophone consists of a transmitter for receiving the voice and
conveying it along the beam of light, and a receiver for taking the light
and converting it into sound—the receiver being the telephone. There is
a small mirror (silvered mica has been used) suspended freely for vibration.
A lens is used to transmit to this the beam of light, and this beam is again
reflected by another lens to the receiver, which consists of a reflector which
has a cell of selenium in its focus, connected, as already stated, with the
telephone and battery. The speaker stands behind the mirror, and the sound
of his voice against the reverse side makes it vibrate in unison with the sounds
uttered. The movements cause a quivering in the reflected beam, and this
in its changing intensity acts on the selenium, which changes its resistance
accordingly, and through the telephone gives forth a sound!</p>

<p>This is the apparently complicated but really simple, and at the same
time wonderful, invention of Professor Bell. By the Photophone not only
sounds but <em>movements</em> can be converted into sound; even the <em>burning of
a candle can be heard</em>! The Photophone is still capable of improvement,
and has not as yet arrived at its full development, for it is stated it can be
made quite independent of a battery or telephone.</p>

<p>There are many phenomena connected with the <em>Polarization of Light</em>.
This requires some notice at our hands. We know that a ray of ordinary
light is supposed to be caused by vibrations of the highly attenuated medium,
æther. These vibrations occur across the direction of the ray; but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
they occur only <em>in one plane</em> the light is said to be “polarized.” Polarization
means possessing poles (like a magnet); the polarized rays have “sides,” as
Newton said, or, as explained by Dr. Whewell, “opposite properties in
opposite directions, so exactly equal as to be capable of accurately neutralizing
each other.” There are some crystals which possess the property
of “double refraction,” and thus a ray of common light passing through such
a crystal is divided into two <em>polarized</em> rays, taking different directions. One
is refracted according to the usual laws of refraction; the other is not, and
the planes of polarization are at right angles. It is difficult within the limits
of this chapter to explain the whole theory of Polarization. In order to
account for certain phenomena in optics, philosophers have assumed that
rays possess polarity; and polarized light is light which has had the
property of Polarization conferred upon it by reflection, refraction, or
absorption. Common light has been compared to a round ruler, and polarized
light to a flat ribbon. Huygens found out, when engaged upon the investigation
of double refraction, that the rays of light, divided by passing through
a crystal (a rhomb) of Iceland spar, possessed certain qualities. When he
passed them through a second rhomb, he found that the brightness, relatively,
of the rays depended upon the position of the second prism, and in some
positions one ray disappeared entirely. The light had been reduced to
vibrations in one plane. In 1808, Malus, happening to direct a double
refracting prism to the windows then reflecting the sunset, found that as he
turned the prism round, the ordinary image of the window nearly disappeared
in two opposite positions; and in two other positions, at right angles, the
“extraordinary” image nearly vanished. So he found that polarization was
produced by reflection as well as by transmission. The differences between
common and polarized light have been summed up by Mr. Goddard as
follows:—</p>

</table></div>

<p>The bundle of glass plates or the tourmaline plate is thus the test for
polarized light, and is termed an analyzer.</p>

<p>The arrangement called a “Nichol’s prism,” made by cutting a prism
of Iceland spar and uniting the halves with a cement, so that only one polarized
ray can pass through it, is termed a <em>Polarizer</em>. It only permits one of
the two rays produced by “double refraction” to pass, and the ray (as said
above) will contain none but transverse vibrations. Polarized light will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
produce beautiful colours. The whole subject is very interesting to the
scientist, but rather a difficult one for the general reader to understand.</p>

<p>Amongst the uses to which light has been put is that of a milk-tester.
The <span class="smcap">Lactoscope</span> will show the quantity of butter contained in a certain
quantity of milk, by diluting it till it displays a certain degree of transparency.
There is another method, by the transmission of light.</p>

<p>The first test is obtained by means of a glass tube about nine inches
long, closed at one end, and containing a small porcelain rod marked with
black lines. A small quantity of milk is measured and placed in the tube.
The black lines cannot at first be seen through the tube, but by adding
water the milk is rendered transparent, and the black lines become visible.
The surface of milk in the tube, by a graduated scale upon it, shows the
percentage of butter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_157.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 167.—Cut card figures.</div>
</div>

<p>The second method is not so simple. A short tube of tin, blackened
on the inside, and supported upright, has an opening on one side, and
opposite this, inside the tube, is a mirror placed at an angle of 45°. “By
placing a lighted candle at a known distance opposite the opening, its light
is reflected in the mirror and thrown upward through the tube. On top of
the tube is placed a round vessel of glass or metal, closed at the bottom by
a sheet of clear glass. The vessel is closed at the top by a cover having
an opening in the centre, in which slides up and down a small tube closed
at the bottom with glass, and having an eye-piece at the top. The milk to
be tested is placed in this vessel on the top of the tin tube, so that the light
of the candle reflected from the mirror passes upward through the milk.
Then, by looking through the sliding tube and moving it up and down, a
point may be found where the image of the candle in the mirror can
be seen through the milk. This device depends, as will be seen, on
observing the light transmitted through a film of milk, and the thickness of
the film is the measure of the value of the milk. The movable tube
contains a graduated scale, and by comparison of this with a printed table,
the percentage of butter in the milk may be ascertained.”</p>

<p>In concluding this chapter we give a few hints for some pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
relaxation for young people, which has many a time created amusement.
The experiment consists in cutting out in paper or cardboard certain
portions of a face or figure, as per the illustration herewith. Fig. 167 gives
the card as cut with the scissors, and the two subsequent faces are the result
of the same held at a less or greater distance from a screen. The illustrations
(fig. 168) will assist those who wish to amuse children by making
rabbits, etc., on the wall. The shadows will be seen perfectly thrown
if the hands be carefully fixed near a good light.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<p>We are all so familiar with the “Magic Lantern,” and the apparatus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
for dissolving views by an arrangement of lenses and manipulation of slides,
that we need do no more than refer to them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 169.—Dissolving views apparatus.</div>
</div>

<p>The various ghost illusions, etc., produced by indirect mirrors, have
already been referred to, the ghost being merely the reflection of an
individual seen through a sheet of glass between the spectators and the
stage. The strong light throws a reflection from a parallel mirror lower
down, and this reflected image can be made to appear amongst the real
actors who are behind the plate-glass in full view of the audience, who are,
however, ignorant of the existence of the glass screen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>For the winter evenings one may easily procure an apparatus for dissolving
views by the oxy-hydrogen light. One, as shown in the illustration
herewith (fig. 169), will answer every purpose, and by this double arrangement
phantasmagoria may be produced, or a fairy tale may be illustrated. The
effect of gradually-approaching night may be given to the picture by means
of a special glass in the lower lanthorn. The apparatus is exhibited by
means of a Drummond light, and is very simple, although a certain supply
of gas is necessary for the performance. But this can be easily procured
by an indiarubber tube, or in a bag supplied for the purpose. Almost any
objects can be used, photographs, etc., etc., and many very comical arrangements
can be made.</p>

<p>We have lately been reading a curious method of obtaining light from
oyster-shells in a Trans-Atlantic magazine. We give an extract wherewith
to close this chapter. The compound is “luminous paint.”</p>

<p>“It has been known that certain compounds of lime and sulphur had
the property of absorbing light, and giving it out again when placed in the
dark. A simple way to do this is to expose clean oyster-shells to a red
heat for half an hour. When cold, the best pieces are picked out and packed
with alternate layers of sulphur in a crucible, and exposed to a red heat for
an hour. When cold, the mass is broken up, and the whitest pieces are
placed in a clean glass bottle. On exposing the bottle to bright sunshine
during the day, it is found that at night its contents will give out a pale
light in the dark. Such a bottle filled more than a hundred years ago still
gives out light when exposed to the sun, proving the persistency of the
property of reproducing light. Very many experiments have been more
recently made in this direction, and the light-giving property greatly enhanced.
The chemicals, ground to a flour, may now be mixed with oils or water for
paints, may be powdered on hot glass, and glass covered with a film of
clear glass, or mixed with celluloid, papier-maché, or other plastic materials.
As a paint, it may be applied to a diver’s dress, to cards, clock dials, sign-boards,
and other surfaces exposed to sunlight during the day; the paint
gives out a pale violet light at night sufficient to enable the objects to be
readily seen in the dark. If the object covered with the prepared paint is not
exposed to the sun, or if the light fades in the dark, a short piece of
magnesium wire burned before it serves to restore the light-giving property.”</p>

<small>SPECTRAL ILLUSIONS.</small></h2>

<p class="center">A SPECTRE VISIBLE—CURIOUS ILLUSIONS—GHOSTS.</p>


<p>We have already given numerous examples of the effects produced by
impressions on the retina by mechanical appliances. We can now in a
short chapter speak of the cause of many spectral illusions, commonly supposed
to be “ghosts” or “spirits.” That there are many “well-authenticated
‘ghost stories’” no one can doubt who has read the literature of
the day; and we ourselves do not in any way desire to throw any doubt
upon the existence of certain so-called “ghosts.” That appearances of
some kind or another are seen by people we know. We ourselves have
seen such, but we cannot say we believe in the popular ghost.</p>

<p>In ancient times mirrors were much employed by the so-called
magicians, and in our day many wonderful ghost effects have been shown
at the (late) Polytechnic Institution. Some people are believers in table-turning
and spiritualism, and mesmerists still attract large audiences, and
appear to possess extraordinary power over some individuals. But apparitions
have been seen by people eminently worthy of credit. The experience
of the learned Doctor, which appeared some months ago in the <cite>Athenæum</cite>,
is a case in point. This narrative is concise and clear. The spectre was
there. How did it get there? Was the “appearance” objective or subjective?
Let us give an extract from the Reverend Doctor’s narrative,
and comment upon it afterwards. We may premise that Dr. Jessopp had
gone over to Lord Orford’s (Mannington Hall), and at eleven o’clock was
busy writing in the library, and was “the only person downstairs.” We
will give this ghost story in the Doctor’s own words. After taking up a
certain volume—time about 1 a.m.:—</p>

<p>“I had been engaged on it about half an hour, and was beginning to
think my work was drawing to a close, when, as I was actually writing, I
saw a large white hand within a foot of my elbow. Turning my head, there
sat a figure of a somewhat large man with his back to the fire, bending
slightly over the table, and apparently examining the pile of books that I
had been at work upon.”... After describing the appearance of the
nocturnal visitor, Dr. Jessopp proceeds:—</p>

<p>“There he sat, and I was fascinated; afraid not of his staying, but lest
he should go. Stopping in my writing I lifted my left hand from the paper,
stretched it out to the pile of books, and moved the top one—my arm passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
in front of the figure, and it vanished.”... Shortly after the figure
appeared again, and “I was penning a sentence to address to him, when I
discovered I did not dare to speak. I was afraid of the sound of my own
voice! There he sat, and there sat I. I turned my head and finished
writing. Having finished my task, I shut the book, and threw it on the
table; it made a slight noise as it fell;—the figure vanished.”</p>

<p>Now here we have a perfectly plain narrative, clear and full. A ghost
appeared; he is described distinctly. How can we account for the apparition?
In the first place, someone might have played a trick, but that idea
was put aside by Dr. Wilks, who attempted to explain the appearances.
He went fully into the question, and as it bears upon our explanation of
the reality of Spectral Illusions, we may condense his evidence. It will
of course be conceded that all the usual objects seen by people are
material, and the image of what we look at is formed upon the retina in the
manner already explained. But <em>all</em> images upon the retina are not
immediately observed; the impression may, to a certain extent, remain.
Words are often impressed upon the brain,—words which we in our sober
senses would never think of repeating,—and yet when we are delirious we
give vent to these expressions, of whose very nature and meaning we are
perfectly unconscious. It is, according to our reference (Dr. Wilks), “quite
possible for the perceptive part of the brain to be thrown into an active
condition quite independent of the normal stimulus conducted to it from the
retina.” If, under these circumstances, an object be viewed independently,
and, as it were, unconsciously, it is merely, we believe, a parallel to the
impression of words before noted. Sound and light are governed by the
same laws. In fevers we fancy we see all kinds of things which have no
existence. In dreams we hear noises; and many a time people dreaming
have been awakened by the report of a gun, or the ringing of a bell which had
no material origin,—the nerves were excited, the “perceptive centre” of
the brain was moved.</p>

<p>But if sight and hearing thus have their origin from the <em>brain</em> and not
from without, there must have been some predisposing cause, some excitement
to induce such a condition of things. “The impressions become
abnormal and subjective,—the normal condition being objective,—the
impression is received from without, and impressed upon the eye.</p>

<p>Now, let us consider the “ghost”! Lately there have been many
instances brought forward of “spiritual” appearances, but we think nobody
has ever seen a “<em>material</em>” ghost; yet on the other hand none of us have
any knowledge of anything in the likeness of a ghost, or that <em>has not a
material basis</em> which <em>can</em> bring forward an image on the retina! Therefore
we are brought to the conclusion that apparitions are spectres emanating
from within the brain, not from any outward manifestation, because it is
within the experience of everybody that in bad health, or disordered digestive
functions, images are produced in the brain and nerves of the eye.</p>

<p>These remarks have perhaps been made before in one form or other, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
as much popular interest is always awakened by the supernatural, or what is
supposed to be supernatural, we may go a little farther, and inquire how
it was that the ghost seen by Dr. Jessopp disappeared when he raised his
arm. Would any ghost be afraid of the Doctor extending his hand? The
fact no doubt occurred as related. The explanation is that the narrator had
been much impressed by a certain picture, which a correspondent soon
identified as a portrait of “Parsons, the Jesuit Father.” The description
given is that of the priest who was described by the Doctor in one of his
books. The association of ideas in the library of a Norfolk house connected
with the Walpoles, with whom Parsons had been a leader, gave rise,
during a period of “forty winks” at midnight, to the spectre.</p>

<p>In the interesting letters written upon “Natural Magic” by Sir David
Brewster, the subject of Spectral Illusions is treated at some length, and with
undoubted authority. Sir David thought the subject worth discussing with
reference to the illusions or spectres mentioned by Dr. Hibbert. Sir David
Brewster gives his own experiences which occurred while he was staying at
the house of a lady in the country.</p>

<p>The illusions appear to have affected her ear as well as the eye. We
shall see in the next chapter how intimately sound and light are connected,
and how the eyes and ears are equally impressed, though in a different way,
by the vibration of particles. The lady referred to was about to go
upstairs to dress for dinner one afternoon, when she heard her husband’s
voice calling to her by name. She opened the door, and nobody was outside;
and when she returned for a moment to the fire she heard the voice
again calling, “Come to me; come, come away,” in a somewhat impatient
tone. She immediately went in search of her husband, but he did not come
in till half an hour afterwards, and of course said he had not called, and told
her where he had been at the time—some distance away. This happened
on the 26th December, 1830, but a more alarming occurrence took place
four days after.</p>

<p>About the same time in the afternoon of the 30th December, the
lady came into the drawing-room, and to her great astonishment she perceived
her husband standing with his back to the fireplace. She had seen
him go out walking a short time previously, and was naturally surprised to
find he had returned so soon. He looked at her very thoughtfully, and
made no answer. She sat down close beside him at the fire, and as he still
gazed upon her she said, “Why don’t you say something!” The figure
immediately moved away towards the window at the farther end of the room,
still gazing at her, “and it passed so close that she was struck by the
circumstance of hearing no step nor sound, nor feeling her dress brushed
against, nor even any agitation of the air.” Although convinced this was
not her husband, the lady never fancied there was anything supernatural in
the appearance of the figure. Subsequently she was convinced that it was
a spectral illusion, although she could not see through the figure which
appeared as substantial as the reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Were it advisable, we could multiply instances. In the <cite>Edinburgh
Journal of Science</cite> these, and many more instances of spectral illusions were
narrated by the husband of the lady. She frequently beheld deceased
relatives or absent friends, and described their dress and general appearance
very minutely. On one occasion she perceived a coach full of skeletons
drive up to the door, and noticed spectral dogs and cats (her own pets’ likenesses)
in the room. There can be no doubt upon these points; the
appearances were manifest and distinct. They were seen in the presence of
other people, in solitude, and in the society of her husband. The lady was
in delicate health, and very sensitive. The spectres appeared in daylight as
well as in the dark, or by candle-light.</p>

<p>Let us now, guided by what we have already written, and by Sir David
Brewster’s experience, endeavour to give a rational explanation of these
illusions. “The mind’s eye is really the body’s eye, and the retina is the
common tablet upon which both classes of impressions are painted, and by
means of which they receive their visual existence according to the same
optical laws.”</p>

<p>“In the healthy state of mind and body the relative intensity of the
two classes of impressions on the retina are nicely adjusted—the bodily and
mental are balanced. The latter are feeble and transient, and in ordinary
temperaments are never capable of disturbing or effacing the direct images of
visible objects.... The mind cannot perform two different functions at
the same instant, and the direction of its attention to one of the two classes
of impressions necessarily produces the extinction of the other; but so rapid
is the exercise of mental power, that the alternate appearance and disappearance
of the two contending impressions is no more recognized than
the successive observations of external objects during the twinkling of the
eyelids.”</p>

<p>We have before illustrated, by means of the pen and the ink-bottle, how
one object is lost sight of when the other is attentively regarded, and a
material picture or scene may be equally lost sight of, and a mental picture
take its place in the eye, when we recall places or people we have seen or
remembered.</p>

<p>We have all heard numerous anecdotes of what is termed “absent-mindedness.”
Some people are quite absorbed in study, and can see or hear
no one in the room when deeply occupied. We may be satisfied then that
“pictures of the mind and spectral illusions are equally impressions upon
the retina, and only differ in the degree of vividness with which they are
seen.” If we press our eyes the phosphorescence becomes apparent, and we
can make a picture of the sun or a lamp visible for a long time to our
closed eyes if we stare at either object for a few seconds, and shut our lids.
So by increasing the sensibility of the retina we can obtain the image, and
alter its colour by pressure on the eye.</p>

<p>It is well known that poisons will affect sight, and belladonna applied
to the eyes will so affect them as to render the sight <em>nil</em>, by enlargement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the “pupil.” If one is out of health there is practically a poisoning of the
system, and when we have a “bilious headache” we see colours and stars
because there is a pressure upon the blood-vessels of the eye. The effects of a
disordered stomach, induced by drinking too much, are well known; objects
are seen double, and most ghosts may be traced to a disordered state of
health of mind or body, brought on by excitement or fatigue. We could
relate a series of ghost stories,—some in our own experience, for we have
seen a ghost equally with our neighbours,—but this is not the place for them.
Although many apparently incontrovertible assertions are made, and many
spectres have been produced to adorn a tale, we must put on record our own
opinion, that every one could be traced to mental impression or bodily
affection had we only the key to the life and circumstances of the ghost-seer.
Many celebrated conjurers will convince us almost against our reason that
our pocket-handkerchief is in the orange just cut up. They will bring live
rabbits from our coat-pockets or vests, and pigeons from our opera-hats.
These are equally illusions. We know what can be done with mirrors. We
have seen ghosts at the Polytechnic, but we must put down all apparitions
as the result of mental or bodily, even unconscious impressions upon the
retina of the eye. There are numerous illusions, such as the Fata Morgana,
the Spectre of the Brocken, etc., which are due to a peculiar state of the
atmosphere, and to the unequal reflection and refraction of light. Those, and
many other optical phenomena, will, with phenomena of heat and sound, be
treated under <span class="smcap">Meteorology</span>, when we will consider the rainbow and the
aurora, with many other atmospheric effects.</p>

<p class="hang">THE EAR, AND HEARING—PHYSIOLOGY OF HEARING AND SOUND—SOUND
AS COMPARED WITH LIGHT—WHAT IS SOUND?—VELOCITY
OF SOUND—CONDUCTIBILITY—THE HARMONOGRAPH.</p>


<p>Before entering upon the science of <span class="smcap">Acoustics</span>, a short description of
the ear, and the mode in which sound is conveyed to our brain, will be no
doubt acceptable to our readers. The study of the organs of hearing is not
an easy one; although we can see the exterior portion, the interior and
delicate membranes are hidden from us in the very hardest bone of the body—the
<i>petrous</i> bone, the temporal and rock-like bone of the head.</p>

</div>

<p>The ear (external) is composed of the auricle, the visible ear, the
auditory canal, and the drum-head, or <i lang="la">membra tympani</i>. The tympanum, or
“drum,” is situated between the external and the internal portions of the ear.
This part is the “middle ear,” and is an air cavity, and through it pass two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
nerves, one to the face, and the other to the tongue. The internal ear is
called the “labyrinth,” from its intricate structure. We give an illustration
of the auditory apparatus of man (fig. 170).</p>

<p>The auricle, or exterior ear, is also represented, but we need not go into
any minute description of the parts. We will just name them (fig. 171).</p>

<p>Sound is the motion imparted to the auditory nerve, and we shall see
in a moment how sound is produced. The undulations enter the auditory
canal, having been taken up by the auricle; the waves or vibrations move at
the rate of 1,100 feet a second, and reach the drum-head, which has motion
imparted to it. This motion or oscillation is imparted to other portions, and
through the liquid in the labyrinth. The impressions of the sound wave are
conveyed to the nerve, and this perception of the movement in the water of
the labyrinth by the nerve threads and the brain causes what we term
“hearing.”</p>

</div>

<p>Let us now endeavour to explain what sound is, and how it arises.
There are some curious parallels between sound and light. When speaking
of light we mentioned some of the analogies between sound and light, and
as we proceed to consider sound, we will not lose sight of the light we have
just passed by.</p>

<p>Sound is the influence of air in motion upon the hearing or auditory
nerves. Light, as we have seen, is the ether in motion, the vibrations striking
the nerves of the eye.</p>

<p>There are musical and unmusical sounds. The former are audible
when the vibrations of the air reach our nerves at regular intervals.
Unmusical sounds, or irregular vibrations, create <em>noise</em>. Now, musical tones
bear the same relation to the ear as colours do to the eye. We must have
a certain number of vibrations of ether to give us a certain colour (<i lang="la">vide</i>
table). “About four hundred and fifty billion impulses in a second” give
red light. The violet rays require nearly double. So we obtain colours by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the different rate of the impingement of impulses on the retina. The
eyes, as we have already learned, cannot receive any more rapidly-recurring
impressions than those producing violet, although as proved, the spectrum
is by no means exhausted, even if they are invisible. In the consideration
of Calorescence we pointed this out. These invisible rays work great
chemical changes when they get beyond violet, and are shown to be heat.
So the rays which do not reach the velocity of red rays are also heat, which
is the effect of motion.</p>

<p>Thus we have <span class="smcap">Heat</span>, <span class="smcap">Light</span>, and <span class="smcap">Sound</span>, all the ascertained results of
vibratory motion. The stillness of the ether around us is known as “Darkness”;
the stillness of the air is “Silence”; the comparative absence of
heat, or molecular motion of bodies is “Cold”!</p>

<p>In the first part we showed how coins impart motion to each other.</p>

<p>When an impulse was given the motion was carried from coin to coin, and at
length the last one in the row flew out. This is the case with sound. The
air molecules strike one upon another, and the wave of “sound” reaches the
tympanum, and thus the impression is conveyed to the brain. We say we
hear—but why we hear, in what manner the movement of certain particles
affects our consciousness, we cannot determine.</p>

<p>That the air is absolutely necessary to enable us to hear can readily
be proved. The experiment has frequently been made; place a bell under
the receiver of an air-pump, and we can hear it ring. But if we exhaust
the air the sound will get fainter and fainter. Similarly, as many of us have
experienced upon high mountains, sounds are less marked. Sound diminishes
in its intensity, just as heat and light do. Sound is reflected and
refracted, as are light and radiant heat. We have already shown the effect
of reflectors upon heat. Sound is caught and reflected in the same way as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
light from mirrors, or as the heat waves in the reflectors. We have what we
term “sounding boards” in pulpits, and speaking tubes will carry sound
for us without loss of power. Echoes are merely reflected sounds.</p>

<p>The velocity of sound is accepted as 1,100 feet in a second, which is
far inferior to the velocity of light. Fogs will retard sound, while water will
carry it. Those who have ever rowed upon a lake will remember how easily
the sound of their voices reached from boat to boat, and Dr. Hutton says
that at Chelsea, on the Thames, he heard a person reading from a distance
of a hundred and forty feet. Some extraordinary instances could be deduced
of the enormous distances sound is said to have travelled. Guns have been
heard at eighty miles distant, and the noise of a battle between the English
and Dutch, in 1672, was heard even in Wales, a distance of two hundred
miles from the scene of action.</p>

<p>Sound always travels with uniform velocity in the air in the same temperature.
But sound! What is the cause of it? How does it arise? These
questions can now be fully answered with reference to the foregoing observations.
Phenomena of vibration render themselves visible by light, heat,
and sound, and to arrive at some definite ideas of sound vibrations we may
compare them to waves, such as may be produced by throwing a stone
into a pond.</p>

<p>There are, so to speak, “standing” waves and “progressive” waves.
The former can be produced (for instance) by thrumming a fiddle-string,
and when the equilibrium of the cord is disturbed, the position of the
equilibrium is passed simultaneously by the string-waves. In water the
waves or vibrating points pass the position of equilibrium in succession.</p>

<p>Waves consist of elevations and depressions alternately, and when we
obtain two “systems” of waves by throwing two stones into water, we can
observe some curious effects. It can be seen how one series of depressions
will come in contact with the other series of depressions, and the
elevations will likewise unite with the result of longer depressions and
elevations respectively; or it may very well be that elevation will meet
depression, and then the so-called “interference” of waves will produce
<em>points of repose</em>. These points are termed <em>nodes</em>. The waves of the string
proceed in the plane of its axis; water waves extend in circles which
increase in circumference.</p>

<p>The progression or propagation of sound may be said to begin when
some tiny globule of matter expands in the air. The air particles
strike one against the other, and so the motion is communicated to the air
waves, which in time reach the ear. But the velocity of the sound is not
equal in all substances. Air will convey it around our earth at the rate of
765 miles an hour, or 1,090 feet in a second. That is, we may accept such
rate as correct at a temperature of 32° Fahr., and at a pressure of thirty
inches, and the velocity increases almost exactly one foot per second for
each degree of temperature above 32°. Therefore on an average, and speaking
in “round numbers,” the estimate of 1,100 feet in a second may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
accepted as correct. In hydrogen gas the rate is much higher. Through
water again it is different, and still faster through iron, glass, and wood, as
will be seen in the following table:—</p>

<p>So there is a considerable difference in the velocities of sound through
the solid substances quoted, but these figures cannot be taken as exact, as
different samples may give different results. In wires and bells the bodies
themselves produce the sounds we hear. In wind instruments and the voice
the air is the cause of the sound.</p>

<p>The very deepest notes are produced by the fewest vibrations. Fourteen
or fifteen vibrations will give us a very low note, if not the very lowest.
The pipe of sixteen feet, closed at its upper end, will produce sound waves
of thirty-two feet. High notes can be formed from vibrations up to 48,000
in a second. Beyond these limits the ear cannot accept a musical sound.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_170.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 172.—The vibration of strings.</div>
</div>

<p>We will explain the phenomenon of the vibration of strings by means of
the illustration. In the cut we find a string or wire, which can be lengthened
or shortened at pleasure by a movable bridge, and stretched by weights
attached to the end (fig. 172).</p>

<p>We can now easily perceive that the shorter and thinner the string is,
and the tighter it is, the number of vibrations will be greater and greater.
The density of it is also to be considered, and when these conditions are in
the smallest proportion then the tone will be highest. The depth will naturally
increase with the thickness, density, and length, and with a decreasing
tension. But we have strings of same thickness stretched to different
degrees of tension, and thus producing different notes. Some strings are
covered with wire to increase their gravity, and thus to produce low notes.</p>

<p>When a number of separate sounds succeed each other in very rapid
course they produce a sound, but to appear as one sound to the ear they
must amount to fifteen or sixteen vibrations every second. The particles of
matter in the air form a connected system, and till they are disturbed they
remain in equilibrium; but the moment they are in any way thrown out of
this state they vibrate as the pendulum vibrates. The particles thus strike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
each other, and impart a motion to the elastic medium air, so a sound
comes to us.</p>

<p>The intensity of sounds gets less the farther it goes from us, or the
loudness of sound is less the greater its distance. The law is, that in
an unvarying medium the loudness varies inversely as the square of the
distance. But Poisson has shown that when air-strata, differing in density,
are existing between the ear and the source of the sound, the intensity or
loudness with which it is heard depends <em>only</em> on the density of the air at the
place the sound originated. This fact has been substantiated by balloonists
who heard a railway whistle quite distinctly when they were nearly 20,000
feet above the ground. It therefore follows that sound can be heard in a
balloon equally well as on the earth at certain given distances. But as the
density of the air diminishes the sound becomes fainter, as has been proved
by the bell rung in the receiver of an air-pump. The velocity of sound, to
a certain extent, depends upon its intensity, as Earnshaw sought to prove; for
he instanced a fact that in the Arctic regions, where sound can be heard for
an immense distance, in consequence of the still and homogeneous air, the
report of a cannon two miles and a half away was heard before the loud
command to “fire,” which must have preceded the discharge. Another
instance showing the difference in hearing through mixed and homogeneous
media may be referred to. In the war with America, when the English and
their foes were on opposite sides of a stream, an American was seen to beat
his drum, but no sound came across. “A coating of soft snow and a thick
atmosphere absorbed the noise.” Glazed, or hard snow, would have a contrary
effect. Reynault also experimentally verified his theory, that sound
when passing through a space of nearly 8,000 feet lost velocity as its
intensity diminished, and in that distance between its arrival at 4,000 feet
and at 7,500 feet, the sound velocity diminished by 2·2 feet per second. He
also tried to demonstrate that sound velocity depended upon its pitch, and
that lower notes travelled with the greater speed.</p>

<p><em>The reflection and refraction of sound</em> follows the same fundamental
laws as the reflection and refraction of light. The reflection of sound is
termed an <em>Echo</em>, which is familiar to all tourists in Switzerland and Ireland
particularly. There are several very remarkable echoes in the world: at
Woodstock, and at the Sicilian cathedral of Gergenti, where the confessions
poured forth near the door to priestly ears were heard by a man concealed
behind the high altar at the opposite end. It is curious that such a spot
should have been accidentally chosen for the Confessional. The whispering
gallery in St. Paul’s is another instance of the echo.</p>

<p>Echoes are produced by the reflection of sound waves from a plane or
even surface. A wall, or even a cloud, will produce echoes. Thunder is
echoed from the clouds. (The celebrated echo of “Paddy Blake,” at
Killarney, which, when you say “How do you do,” is reported to reply, “Very
well, thank you,” can scarcely be quoted as a scientific illustration.) And
the hills of Killarney contain an echo, and the bugle sounds are beautifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
repeated. In the cases of ordinary echo, when the speaker waits for the
answer, he must place himself <em>opposite</em> the rock. If he stand at the side the
echo will reply to another person in a corresponding place on the farther side,
for the voice then strikes the rock at an angle, and the angle of reflection
is the same, as in the case of light.</p>

<p>But if it should happen that there are a number of reflecting surfaces
the echo will be repeated over and over again, as at the Lakes of Killarney.
The Woodstock Echo, already referred to, and mentioned by several writers,
repeats seventeen syllables by day, and twenty by night. In Shipley there
is even a greater repetition. Of course the echo is fainter, because the waves
are weaker if the reflecting surface be flat. But, as in the case of the
mirrors reflecting light, a circular or concave surface will increase the
intensity. A watch placed in one mirror will be heard ticking in the other
focus. Whispering galleries carry sound by means of the curved surface.
Sir John Herschel mentions an echo in the Menai Suspension Bridge. The
blow of a hammer on one of the main piers will produce the sound from
each of the crossbeams supporting the roadway, and from the opposite pier
576 feet distant, as well as many other repetitions.</p>

<p>Refraction of sound is caused by a wave of sound meeting another
medium of different density, just as a beam of light is refracted from water.
One sound wave imparts its motion to the new medium, and the new wave
travels in a different direction. This change is refraction. The sound
waves are refracted in different directions, according to the velocity it can
acquire in the medium. If a sound pass from water into air it will be bent
towards the perpendicular, because sound can travel faster in water than in
air. If it pass from air into water its force will cause it to assume a less
perpendicular direction, there being greater velocity in water. The velocity
in air is only 1,100 feet in a second in our atmosphere. In water sound
travels 4,700 feet in the same time. When the wave of sound falls upon a
medium parallel to the refracting surface there is, however, no refraction—only
a change of velocity, not direction.</p>

<p>When sound waves are prevented from dispersing the voice can be
carried a great distance. Speaking tubes and trumpets, as well as ear
trumpets, are examples of this principle, and of the reflection of sound.</p>

<p>There are many very interesting experiments in connection with
Acoustics, some of which we will now impart to our readers. We shall then
find many ingenious inventions to examine,—the Audiphone, Telephone,
Megaphone, and Phonograph, which will occupy a separate chapter. We
now resume.</p>

<p>Amongst the experiments usually included in the course of professors
and lecturers who have a complete apparatus at their command, and which
at first appear very complicated and difficult, there are some which can be
performed with every-day articles at hand. There is no experiment in
acoustics more interesting than that of M. Lissajons, which consists, as is
well known to our scientists, of projecting upon a table or other surface, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
the aid of oxy-hydrogen light, the vibratory curves traced by one of the
prongs of a tuning-fork. We can perform without difficulty a very similar
experiment with the humble assistance of the common knitting-needle.</p>

<p>Fix the flexible steel needle firmly in a cork, which will give it
sufficient support; fasten then at the upper extremity a small ball of sealing
wax, or a piece of paper about the size of a large pea. If the cork in
which the needle is fixed be held firmly in one hand, and you cause the
needle to vibrate by striking it, and then letting it sway of itself, or with a
pretty strong blow with a piece of wood, you will perceive the little pellet of
wax or paper describe an ellipse more or less elongated, or even a circle
will be described if the vibrations be frequent. The effect is much enhanced
if the experiment be performed beneath a lamp, so that plenty of light may
fall upon the vibrating needle. In this case, the persistence of impressions
upon the retina admits of one seeing the vibrating circle in successive
positions, and we may almost fancy when the needle is struck with sufficient
force, that an elongated conical glass, like the old form of champagne glass,
is rising from the cork, as shown in the illustration annexed (fig. 173).</p>

<p>Acoustics may be studied in the same way as other branches of
physical science. We will describe an interesting experiment, which gives
a very good idea of the transmission of sounds through solid bodies. A
silver spoon is fastened to a thread, the ends of which are thrust into both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
ears, as shown in fig. 174; we then slightly swing the spoon until we make
it touch the edge of the table; the transmission of sound is in consequence
so intense that we are ready to believe we are listening to the double
diapason of an organ. This experiment explains perfectly the transmission
of spoken words by means of the string of a telephone, another contrivance
which any one may make for himself without any trouble whatever. Two
round pieces of cardboard are fitted to two cylinders of tin-plate, as large round
as a lamp-glass, and four-and-a-half inches in length. If the two rounds of
cardboard are connected by a long string of sixteen to eighteen yards, we
can transmit sounds from one end to the other of this long cord; the
speaker pronouncing the words into the first cylinder, and the listener
placing his ear against the other. It is easy to demonstrate that sound takes
a certain time to pass from one point to another. When one sees in the
distance a carpenter driving in a stake, we find that the sound produced by
the blow of the hammer against the wood only reaches the ear a few seconds
after the contact of the two objects. We see the flash at the firing of a
gun, before hearing the sound of the report—of course on the condition that
we are at a fairly considerable distance, as already remarked upon.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 175.—Musical glasses.</div>
</div>

<p>We can show the production of the Gamut by cutting little pieces of
wood of different sizes, which one throws on to a table; the sounds produced
vary according to the size of the different pieces. The same effect may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
obtained much better by means of goblets more or less filled with water;
they are struck with a short rod, and emit a sound which can be modified
by pouring in a greater or less quantity of water; if the performer is gifted
with a musical ear, he can obtain, by a little arrangement, a perfect Gamut
by means of seven glasses which each give a note (fig. 175). A piece of music
may be fairly rendered in this manner, for the musical glasses frequently
produce a very pure silvery sound. We will complete the elementary
principles of acoustics by describing a very curious apparatus invented by
M. Tisley, the <span class="smcap">Harmonograph</span>. This instrument, which we can easily
describe, is a most interesting object of study. The Harmonograph belongs
to mechanics in principle, and to the science of acoustics in application.
We will first examine the apparatus itself. It is composed of two pendulums,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> (fig. 176), fixed to suspensions. Pendulum <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> supports a
circular plate, <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span>, on which we may place a small sheet of paper, as shown in
the illustration. This paper is fixed by means of small brass clips.
Pendulum <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> supports a horizontal bar, at the extremity of which is a glass
tube, <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>, terminating at its lower extremity with a capillary opening; this
tube is filled with aniline ink, and just rests on the sheet of paper; the
support and the tube are balanced by a counterpoise on the right. The two
pendulums, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, are weighted with round pieces of lead, which can be
moved at pleasure, so that various oscillations may be obtained. The ratio
between the oscillations of the two pendulums may be exactly regulated by
means of pendulum <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> carrying a small additional weight, the height of which
may be regulated by means of a screw and a small windlass. If we give to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
pendulum <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> a slight movement of oscillation, the point of tube <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span> traces a
straight line on the paper placed in <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span>; but if we move pendulum <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, the
paper also is displaced, and the point of tube <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span> will trace curves, the shape
of which varies with the nature of the movement of pendulum <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, the relation
between the oscillations of the two pendulums, etc. If the pendulums
oscillate without any friction the curve will be clear, and the point will pass
indefinitely over the same track, but when the oscillations diminish, the curve
also diminishes in size, still preserving its form, and tending to a point
corresponding with the position of repose of the two pendulums. The
result is therefore that the curves traced by the apparatus, of which we
produce three specimens (figs. 177, 178, 179), are traced in a continuous
stroke, commencing with the part of the greatest amplitude.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_176.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 176.—M. Tisley’s Harmonograph.</div>
</div>

<p>By changing the relation and phases of the oscillations we obtain
curves of infinitely varied aspect. M. Tisley has a collection of more than
three thousand curves, which we have had occasion to glance over, in which
we failed to meet with two corresponding figures. The ratio between these
curves corresponds with some special class, of which the analyst may define
the general characters, but which is outside our present subject. By giving
the plate P a rotatory movement, we obtain spiral curves of a very curious
effect, but the apparatus is more complicated. Considered from this point of
view it constitutes an interesting mechanical apparatus, showing the combination
of oscillations, and resolving certain questions of pure mechanics.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
From the point of view of acoustics it constitutes a less curious object of
study. The experiments of M. Lissajons have proved that the vibrations
of diapasons are oscillations similar to, though much more rapid than those
of the pendulum. We can therefore with this apparatus reproduce all the
experiments of M. Lissajons, with this difference, that the movements being
slower are easier to study. When the ratio between the <em>number of vibrations</em>—we
purposely use the term vibration instead of the term oscillation—is a
whole number, we obtain figs. 177 and 178. If the ratio is not exact, we
obtain fig. 179, which is rather irregular in appearance, corresponding to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
distortions noticeable in M. Lissajon’s experiments. Fig. 178 has been traced
in the exact ratio 2:3; fig. 177 in the ratio 1:2; and fig. 179 corresponds
to the ratio 1:2 and a small fraction, which causes the irregularity
of the figure.</p>

<p>In considering the harmony of figs. 177 and 178,—the first of which corresponds
to the octave, the second to the fifth, whilst fig. 179 corresponds to
the disagreeable interval of the ninth,—one is almost tempted to put a certain
faith in the fundamental law of <em>simple ratios</em> as the basis of harmony. At
first sight this appears beyond doubt, but perhaps musicians would be hardly
content with the explanation. M. Tisley’s Harmonograph, it will be seen,
is a rather complicated apparatus; and I will now explain how it may be
constructed by means of a few pieces of wood. I endeavoured to construct
as simple an apparatus as possible, and with the commonest materials, feeling
that it is the best means of showing how it is possible for everybody to
reproduce these charming curves of musical intervals. Also I completely
excluded the employment of metals, and I constructed my apparatus entirely
with pieces of wooden rulers, and old cigar boxes. I set to work in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
following manner: on the two consecutive sides of a drawing board I fixed
four small pieces of wood (fig. 180), side by side in twos, having at the end a
small piece of tin-plate forming a groove (fig. 181). In these grooves nails
are placed which support the pendulums. The piece of wood is placed on
the corner of the table, so that the pendulums which oscillate in two planes at
right angles, are in two planes that are sensibly parallel to the sides of the
table. The pendulums are made of a thin lath, with two small pieces of
wood fixed to them containing some very pointed nails, on which the
pendulum oscillates. Fig. 182 gives an illustration. The pendulums have a
pin fixed in vertically, which passes through a piece of wood, and by means
of a hinge connects the upper ends of the two pendulums. This contrivance
of the pin is very useful, and if care is taken to make the hole through the
hinge in the form of a double cone, as shown in fig. 182, <i>c</i>, it makes a perfect
joint, which allows the piece of wood to be freely moved.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 184.—Details of mechanism.</div>
</div>

<p>To complete the apparatus, the heads of the two pendulums are united
by the hinge, at the bend of which a slender glass tube is fixed, which traces
the curves. The hinge is given in fig. 184, and to its two extremities are
adjusted the two pins of the pendulum (fig. 183). The pendulums are
encircled with round pieces of lead, which can be fixed at any height by
means of a screw.</p>

<p class="hang">THE TOPOPHONE—THE MEGAPHONE—THE AUTOPHONE—THE AUDIPHONE—THE
TELEPHONE—THE PHONOGRAPH—THE MICROPHONE.</p>


<p>We propose in this chapter to give as shortly as possible a description of
the various instruments lately come into use, by means of which, and electricity,
sounds can be carried from place to place, and their locality identified. It
is only within the last few years that these wonderful inventions have come
into use, and in a measure superseded the at one time invincible electric
telegraph. The Telephone is now in daily use in London and other places,
and its novelty, if not all its capability, has been discounted. The Phonograph
has also been frequently seen. So we will on this occasion commence
with the <span class="smcap">Topophone</span>, a rather novel instrument.</p>

<p>As the name indicates, the <span class="smcap">Topophone</span> is an apparatus for discovering
the position of a sound, from the Greek words signifying a “place” and
“sound.” The <em>sources</em> of sound can be found by it, and indeed this is its
actual and practical use. It is claimed for this new apparatus that it stands
in the same relation to the sailor as his old and trusty friends, the compass
and sextant. These in navigation inform the steersman as to his course, and
tells him his position by observation. The Topophone will tell him whence
a sound arises, its origin wherever it may be; and this in a fog is no
mean advantage. Suppose a ship to be approaching a dangerous coast in
a fog. We are all aware how deceptive sounds are when heard through such
a medium. We cannot tell from what precise direction the horn, whistle, or
bell is sounding. The Topophone will give us the exact spot, and we can
then, from our general knowledge of the locality, work our vessel up the
river, or into the harbour, in safety.</p>

<p>The Topophone was invented in 1880, by Professor Alfred Mayer, an
American, and is based upon the well-known theory of sound waves. These,
as we have already explained, exist in the air; and if the theory of sound
waves has perfected the Topophone, we can fairly say that it has confirmed
the supposed form of the sound waves. “Sound,” says the inventor of the
apparatus, “is supposed to be a particle continually expanding in the air,
composed of a wave produced by compression, and followed by rarefaction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
A continuous sound is a series of these particles or globules spreading and
expanding as the water-rings in a pond.” This much will be at once
perceived.</p>

<p>Now, suppose a person up to his shoulders in a pond of water, and
someone throws a stone into it. If that person extend his arms and hands
at right angles facing the sound, each hand would touch the edge of a ripple
as it came towards him across the pond. He would then be facing the
source of the ripples or waves, and look along a radius of the circle formed
by the waves. But if he please, he can move his body so that both hands
shall touch the same wave at the same time, or he might turn away from
the source, and only one hand would touch the wave. But when both hands
are actually washed by the same circular ripple he must be facing the source
of it. Any position in which his fingers did not touch the ripple almost at
the same instant, would not be facing the source of the wave ripples. So
by turning and extending his hands, he could with his eyes shut find out
whether he was or was not facing the original source of the waves.</p>

<p>This applied to sound waves in the air is the whole theory of the
Topophone, which, however, depends for its usefulness upon the same note
being sounded by all horns and whistles. One note must be better than all
the others, and that note, probably C (treble), caused by about two hundred
and sixty vibrations per second, has been found most applicable. If all
whistles and horns can by law be compelled to adjust themselves to this
note, then the Topophone will be a real and lasting benefit.</p>

<p>Let us now look at the apparatus itself.</p>

<p>It being conceded that the resonators are in the same key as the Foghorn,—and
this is necessary,—they are placed upon the deck of the vessel.
An ear-tube of indiarubber is carried from each of these “resonators”
into the cabin. These tubes unite and again separate, ending in small pieces
ready to be fitted to the ears. The apparatus is fixed on deck, and the
arrangement which supports it passes into the cabin, and can be turned
about in any direction. Of course in this case a dial point is necessary to
indicate the direction in which the instrument is turned. If the machine be
worn on the shoulders of the officer of the watch he can move as he pleases,
and wants no indicator.</p>

<p>The Topophone when used is so constructed, that when a horn is heard,
and when the listener is facing the sound, he can <em>hear nothing</em>! When not
facing the origin of the sound he can hear the horn very well, but the
moment the resonators receive the sound together as they face the source, a
very low murmur is heard, or perhaps no sound at all.—Why?</p>

<p>A certain pitch of tone is composed of vibrations or waves of equal
length. In all waves there is a hollow and a crest. One neutralizes the
other. The hollow of a sound wave meeting the crest of another wave
“interferes” to produce silence, stillness, a dead level. So in “light”; two
rays will produce darkness. We will endeavour to explain this.</p>

<p>If we have two equal strings, each performing an equal number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
vibrations in a second, they will produce equal sound waves, and the sound
produced by both together will be uninterrupted, and twice as loud as one of
them. But if one string vibrate, say one hundred times, and the other one
hundred and one times in a second, they will <em>not</em> be in unison, and one will
gain upon the other string, till after it has got to fifty vibrations it will be
half a vibration ahead. At that moment they will neutralize each other, and
silence will ensue for an appreciable time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_182.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 185.—The Megaphone.</div>
</div>

<p>In the case of light suppose a <em>red</em> ray strikes the eye, and another
red ray to come upon it from somewhere else. If the difference between
its distance and the other point from the spot in the retina on which
the first ray fell, is the 258/1000 part of an inch, or exactly twice, thrice,
four times as much, etc., that distance, the light will be seen twice as strong.
But if the difference in the distances between the points whence the light
comes be only <em>one-half the 258/1000 part of an inch</em>, or 1&frac12;, 2&frac12;, 3&frac12;, or 4&frac12;
times that distance, one light will extinguish the other, and darkness will
be the result. Now this is precisely what happens in the case of the
Topophone. To return to our simile of water waves. If two stones be cast
into a pond, and two equal and similar waves produced, and if they reach a
certain place at the same moment, they will make one large wave. But if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
one followed the other a little, so that the hollow of one coincided with the
crest of the other, and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>, the waves would obliterate each other, and
a dead level would result. One tube of the Topophone is half a wave length
longer than the other, and when the resonators are in a line and receive the
wave at the same time, one ear hears the elevation of the sound wave, and
the other the depression,—the sound is neutralized, and comparative, if not
actual, silence results. The sailor knows in what direction the land lies, and
can calculate his distance, or anchor if he please.</p>

<p>If amongst our readers there be any who wish to make for themselves
an acoustic signalling apparatus there is physically nothing to prevent them
from constructing such an instrument as that shown in the annexed woodcut
(fig. 185). It is founded upon the speaking-trumpet principle, which is
supposed to have been originated by Samuel Markland, in 1670.</p>

<p>Kircher, in his “<cite>Ars magna et umbra</cite>,” and in his “<cite>Phonurgia</cite>,” mentions
a kind of speaking-trumpet, or <i lang="fr">porte voix</i>, of gigantic dimensions, and called
the “Horn of Alexander.” According to Kircher, the instrument was used
by Alexander the Great to summon his soldiers from a distance of ten
miles. The diameter of the circumference was about eight feet, and Kircher
conjectured that the instrument was mounted upon three supports.</p>

<p>During the last century, a German professor, named Huth, made a
model of the horn, and found it answered every purpose of a speaking-trumpet
with most powerful results, but we beg leave to doubt whether
the instrument really carried the voice to any very great distance.</p>

<p>The Acoustic Cornet, which is the counterpart of the speaking-trumpet,
has been made in many different forms during the last two centuries, but
none of them to the present time consist of anything more intricate than a
simple tube with a mouthpiece and bell-shaped orifice.</p>

<p>Professor Edison, however, in his researches regarding the conveyance
of sounds, has made numerous and interesting experiments. On one
occasion, with his Megaphone he carried on a conversation at a distance of
nearly two miles, without any other assistance from instruments except a few
little cornets of cardboard. These constitute the Megaphone, which may be
regarded as a curiosity, considering the effects produced by such simple
means. The illustration (fig. 185) represents the instrument which is (or
was lately) fixed upon the balcony of Mr. Edison’s house. At a mile-and-a-half
distant from the house, at a spot indicated by the two birds in
the picture, another instrument was fixed, and conversation was carried on
with ease.</p>

<p>Perhaps the present opportunity will be the most convenient to speak
of the <span class="smcap">Autophone</span>, although it is more a musical than an acoustic instrument.
Until lately Barbary organs and piano organs have been the only
means by which poor people have been able to hear any music, and that not
of a very elevated class. Besides, there is a good deal of expense connected
with the possession of an organ. But the Americans, with a view to
popularize music, have invented the <span class="smcap">Autophone</span>, which is simply a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
mechanical accordeon, manufactured by the Autophone Company, of Ithaca,
New York.</p>

<p>The principle of the instrument is represented in fig. 186, and is
extremely simple. An upright frame carries within it on one side a bellows,
and on the other a flexible air chamber, which serves as a reservoir.</p>

<p>The upper portion contains a set of stops like an accordeon, but the
escape of the air through the small vibrating plates can only take place by
the upper surface of the frame work, upon which slides a thin plate of Bristol
board pierced with holes at convenient distances, and set in motion
by the mechanism shown in the annexed diagram (fig. 187).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 186.—The Autophone.</div>
</div>

<p>The figure represents an axle furnished with a series of “washers,”
which, acting upon the plate, cause it to move round. It is the bellows
movement that turns the axle by the aid of two “catches,” <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, which
work upon a toothed wheel fixed upon it.</p>

<p>The “catch” <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> moves the paper on which the tune is “perforated,”
when the bellows is empty, the other catch when it is distended; but a counter
catch, <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>, represented by the dotted lines in the illustration, is so arranged
that the paper cannot pass on except the tooth of the catch <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span> is opposite
a hole pierced upon the plate above. In the contrary case there is no
movement of the paper during the dilatation of the bellows. The effect of
this very ingenious arrangement is to give to the “musical” band of “board”
an irregular movement, but it economises it in the case of sustained notes.
The whole action of the instrument depends upon the correct working of the
bellows.</p>

<p>The effect, from an artistic point of view, certainly leaves something to
be desired, but the instrument is cheap, and not cumbersome, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
slips of paper upon which the music is “cut out” can be made by machinery,
and consequently are not dear. So far, the Autophone is fitted for popular
favour and use, and may supersede the barrel organ.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Audiphone</span> is an instrument to conduct sound to the ear, to
supplement it when temporary or partial deafness has occurred. Very
likely many of our readers have observed ladies carrying large black
fans on occasions,—at church, or lecture, or theatre,—and wondered why,
perhaps. Those “fans” are Audiphones. The instrument is made of
vulcanized rubber, and consists of a long flexible disc supported by a
handle. To the upper edge of the “fan” are attached cords, which pass
through a clip on the handle. If the person who wishes to hear by
means of the Audiphone will hold the fan against the upper teeth,—the
convex side of the fan outward,—he or she will hear distinctly, for
the vibrations of sound are collected and strike upon the teeth and bones,
and act upon the auditory nerves from within, precisely as the vibrations
act from without through the auricle. We need hardly add that if the ear be
injured the Audiphone will be of no use. A writer says: “From personal
observation with the Audiphone it appears to convey the sonorous vibrations
to the ear through the teeth, just as a long wooden rod held in the teeth will
convey the vibrations of the sounding-board of a piano, though the piano
is in another room and out of hearing by the ear. In using the Audiphone
during conversation there is no movement or vibration felt by the teeth; in
listening to a piano there is a very faint sensation as if the Audiphone
vibrated slightly, while with the handle of the Audiphone resting on the
sounding-board of the piano the vibrations are so violent as to be painful to
the teeth. By closing the ears a person with even acute hearing can observe
the admirable manner in which the instrument conveys spoken words to the
ear. The Audiphone will prove to be of great value to deaf mutes, as it
enables them to hear their own voices, and thus to train them to express
words, while, before, they could only make inarticulate sounds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>We have a variation of this instrument which has been introduced
employing a diaphragm held in a telephone mouthpiece, and free to vibrate
under the influence of sounds. This is connected by a string to a bit of
wood that may be held in the teeth. In use the hearer places the wood
between his teeth, the string is drawn tight, and the speaker speaks through
the telephone mouthpiece, the vibrations of the diaphragm being then conveyed
to the teeth through the stretched string. This apparatus works
very successfully, and ladies use it, but it is not so convenient for general use
as the Audiphone.</p>

<p>The Telephone is now in daily use in London, and is by no means
strange to the majority of our countrymen, still some description of it will
probably be acceptable, and a glance at its history may prove interesting.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 189.—The “receiving” apparatus.</div>
</div>

<p>In speaking of the Telephone, we must not lose sight of the facts before
mentioned, as regards our sense of hearing, and the manner in which the ear
acts by the series of bones termed the hammer, the anvil, and stirrup. In
the process of reproduction of tone in the magnetic instruments, the
mechanism of the human ear was, to a certain extent, imitated, and a
diaphragm, by vibrations, generates and controls an electric current.</p>

<p>Professor Wheatstone was the first person to employ the electric wire for
the transmission of sounds, but Professor Philip Reiss, of Friedrichsdorf, was the
first to make the experiment of producing musical sounds at a distance. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
first instrument was of a most primitive nature; subsequently he produced
an instrument of which fig. 188 is the Telephone, fig. 189 the “receiver.”</p>

<p>In fig. 188, it will be seen that there is an aperture on the top and one
at the side; the latter is the mouthpiece. The top aperture is covered with
a membrane which is stretched very tightly. When a person speaks or sings
into the mouthpiece his voice is at once concentrated upon the tight
membrane, which it causes to vibrate in a manner corresponding with the
vibrations of the voice. There are two binding screws, one at each side.
To the centre of the tight membrane a piece of platinum is fixed, and this
is connected with the binding screw on one side, in which a wire from the
battery is fixed. On the membrane is a tripod, the feet of which (two) rest
in metal cups, one of them being in a mercury cup connected with the
binding screw at the opposite side to that already mentioned. The third
“foot”—a platinum point—is on the platinum in the centre of the
membrane or top, and moves with it. Every time the membrane is
stretched by a vibration the platinum point is touched, and the closed circuit
is broken by the return of each vibration.</p>

<p>The receiving instrument (fig. 189) consists of a coil enclosing an iron
rod, and fixed upon a hollow sounding box. It is founded upon a fact
discovered by Professor Henry, that iron bars when magnetized by an
electric current become a little longer, and at the interruption of the current
resume their former length. Thus in the receiver the iron will become
alternately longer and shorter in accordance with the vibrations of the
membrane in the box far away, and so the longitudinal vibrations of the bar
of iron will be communicated to the sounding box, and become perfectly
audible. This instrument, however, could only produce the “pitch” of sound,
“not different degrees of intensity, or other qualities of tones.” It merely sang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
with its own little trumpet whatever was sung into it; for all the waves
were produced by an electric current of a certain and uniform strength, and
therefore the sound waves were of the same size.</p>

<p>But in 1874, Mr. Elisha Gray, of Chicago, improved Reiss’ instrument,
and discovered a method by which the intensity or loudness of tones, as well
as their “pitch,” were transmitted and reproduced. In this method he
employed electrical vibrations of varying strength and rapidity, and so was
enabled to reproduce a tune. Subsequently he conceived the notion of
controlling the vibrations by means of a diaphragm, which responded to every
known sound, and by this he managed to transmit speech in an articulate
manner.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_188.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 191.—Bell’s Telephone (Receiver).</div>
</div>

<p>In 1876, Professor Graham Bell sent a Telephone to the Centennial
Exhibition at Philadelphia. Mr. Bell, according to the report, managed to
produce a variation of strength of current in exact proportion to the particle
of air moved by the sound. A piece of iron attached to a membrane, and
moved to and fro in proximity to an electro magnet, proved successful. The
battery and wire of the electro magnet are in circuit with the telegraph wire,
and the wire of another electro magnet at the receiving station. This
second magnet has a solid bar of iron for core, which is connected at one
end, by a thick disc of iron, to an iron tube surrounding the coil and bar.
The free circular end of the tube constitutes one pole of the electro magnet,
and the adjacent free end of the bar core the other. A thin circular iron
disc held pressed against the end of the tube by the electro-magnetic attraction,
and free to vibrate through a very small space without touching the
central pole, constitutes the sounder by which the electric effect is reconverted
into sound. The accompanying illustrations (figs. 190, 191) show Mr. Bell’s
Telephone as described.</p>

<p>The Telephone, subsequently simplified by Professor Bell, is shown in
the two following illustrations (figs. 192, 193). The voice strikes against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
diaphragm, and it begins to vibrate. The <em>sound</em> is not conveyed by the wire;
the <em>motion</em> is communicated, and the vibrations become sound waves again.
The Telephone consists of a cylindrical magnet encircled at one end by a
bobbin, on which is wound a quantity of fine insulated copper wire. The
magnet and coil are contained in a wooden case, the ends of the coil being
soldered to thick copper wire, which traverse the “wooden envelope,” and
terminate in the binding screws. In front of the magnet is a thin circular iron
plate, in which is the mouthpiece. The drawings will explain the instrument.</p>

<p>Mr. Edison also invented a Telephone like Gray’s, and made the
discovery, that when properly prepared, carbon would change its resistance
with pressure, and that the ratio of these changes corresponded with the
pressure. This solved the problem of the production of speech. The
carbon is placed between two plates of platinum connected in the circuit
and near the diaphragm, and the carbon receives the pressure from it by
means of the mouthpiece.</p>

<p>When we come to <span class="smcap">Magnetism</span> and <span class="smcap">Electricity</span> we may have some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>thing
more to say respecting the mysteries of the Telephone and its later
developments. At present we are only concerned with it as a sound
conveyer, and it answers its purpose admirably, although somewhat liable to
attract other sounds or vibrations from neighbouring wires.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Phonograph</span>, a mechanical invention of Mr. Edison, does not
make use of electricity, although the vibratory motion of the diaphragm is
utilized. It, in a simple form, consists of a diaphragm so arranged as to
operate upon a small stylus, placed just opposite and below the centre, and
a brass cylinder, six or eight inches long, by three or four in diameter,
mounted upon a horizontal axis, extending each way beyond its ends for a
distance about its own length.</p>

<p>“A spiral groove is cut in the circumference of the cylinder, from one
end to the other, each spiral of the groove being separated from its neighbour
by about one-tenth of an inch. The shaft or axis is also cut by a screw
thread corresponding to the spiral groove of the cylinder, and works in
screw bearings; consequently when the cylinder is caused to revolve, by
means of a crank that is fitted to the axis for this purpose, it receives a
forward or backward movement of about one-tenth of an inch for every turn
of the same, the direction, of course, depending upon the way the crank
is turned. The diaphragm is firmly supported by an upright casting
capable of adjustment, and so arranged that it may be removed altogether
when necessary. When in use, however, it is clamped in a fixed position
above or in front of the cylinder, thus bringing the stylus always opposite
the groove as the cylinder is turned. A small, flat spring attached to the
casting extends underneath the diaphragm as far as its centre and carries
the stylus, and between the diaphragm and spring a small piece of india-rubber
is placed to modify the action, it having been found that better
results are obtained by this means than when the stylus is rigidly attached
to the diaphragm itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 194.—Mode of using the Telephone.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>“The action of the apparatus will now be readily understood from
what follows. The cylinder is first very smoothly covered with tin-foil, and
the diaphragm securely fastened in place by clamping its support to the base
of the instrument. When this has been properly done, the stylus should
lightly press against that part of the foil over the groove. The crank is now
turned, while, at the same time, someone speaks into the mouthpiece of the
instrument, which will cause the diaphragm to vibrate, and as the vibrations
of the latter correspond with the movements of the air producing them, the
soft and yielding foil will become marked along the line of the groove by a
series of indentations of different depths, varying with the amplitude of the
vibrations of the diaphragm; or in other words, with the inflections or
modulations of the speaker’s voice. These inflections may therefore be
looked upon as a sort of visible speech, which, in fact, they really are. If
now the diaphragm is removed, by loosening the clamp, and the cylinder
then turned back to the starting point, we have only to replace the diaphragm
and turn in the same direction as at first, to hear repeated all that has been
spoken into the mouthpiece of the apparatus; the stylus, by this means, being
caused to traverse its former path, and consequently, rising and falling with
the depressions in the foil, its motion is communicated to the diaphragm,
and thence through the intervening air to the ear, where the sensation of
sound is produced.</p>

<p>“As the faithful reproduction of a sound is in reality nothing more
than a reproduction of similar acoustic vibrations in a given time, it at once
becomes evident that the cylinder should be made to revolve with absolute
uniformity at all times, otherwise a difference more or less marked between
the original sound and the reproduction will become manifest. To secure
this uniformity of motion, and produce a practically working machine for
automatically recording speeches, vocal and instrumental music, and per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>fectly
reproducing the same, the inventor devised an apparatus in which a
plate replaces the cylinder. This plate, which is ten inches in diameter, has
a volute spiral groove cut in its surface on both sides from its centre to
within one inch of its outer edge; an arm guided by the spiral upon the
under side of the plate carries a diaphragm and mouthpiece at its extreme
end. If the arm be placed near the centre of the plate and the latter
rotated, the motion will cause the arm to follow the spiral outward to the
edge. A spring and train of wheel-work regulated by a friction governor
serves to give uniform motion to the plate. The sheet upon which the
record is made is of tin-foil. This is fastened to a paper frame, made by
cutting a nine-inch disc from a square piece of paper of the same dimensions
as the plate. Four pins upon the plate pass through corresponding eyelet-holes
punched in the four corners of the paper, when the latter is laid upon
it, and thus secure accurate registration, while a clamping-frame hinged to
the plate fastens the foil and its paper frame securely to the latter. The
mechanism is so arranged that the plate may be started and stopped
instantly, or its motion reversed at will, thus giving the greatest convenience
to both speaker and copyist.</p>

<p>“The articulation and quality of the Phonograph, although not yet
perfect, is full as good as the Telephone was. The instrument, when perfected
and moved by clock-work, will undoubtedly reproduce every condition
of the human voice, including the whole world of expression in speech and
song, and will be used universally.</p>

<p>“The sheet of tin-foil or other plastic material receiving the impressions
of sound, will be stereotyped or electrotyped so as to be multiplied and
made durable; or the cylinder will be made of a material plastic when used,
and hardening afterward. Thin sheets of <i lang="fr">papier maché</i>, or of various substances
which soften by heat, would be of this character. Having provided
thus for the durability of the Phonograph plate, it will be very easy to make
it separable from the cylinder producing it, and attachable to a corresponding
cylinder anywhere and at any time. There will doubtless be a standard
of diameter and pitch of screw for Phonograph cylinders. Friends at a
distance will then send to each other Phonograph letters, which will talk at
any time in the friend’s voice when put upon the instrument.” (<cite>Scribner.</cite>)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Microphone</span> (an outcome of the Telephone) was discovered by
Professor Hughes, of London. It is an instrument which in its main
features consists of a carbon “pencil,” so suspended that one end rests upon
a carbon “die.” The instrument being connected with a Telephone by the
circuit wires, will reproduce faint sounds very distinctly. Once a Microphone
was put into a preacher’s pulpit, and joined to a private telegraph wire which
led to a gentleman’s house. The owner was thus enabled to hear the
sermon. So long as it is thus connected every minute sound, even a fly’s
footstep, will be faithfully reproduced.</p>

<p class="center">THE TUNING-FORK—THE SYREN—SOUND FIGURES—SINGING FLAMES.</p>


<p>We cannot close the subject of Sound without some mention of the
Musical Pitch, and various instruments and experiments which have from
time to time been made to discover the pitch, sound, and vibrations, and
even to <em>see</em> Sound. To understand the vibrations or “pitch” of a musical
note we may study the illustration, which shows us a tuning-fork in vibration.</p>

<p>You will perceive that each prong of the tuning-fork beats the air in an
opposite direction at the same time, say from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> (fig. 196). The prong
strikes the air, and the wave thus created strikes again outward, and the
condensation thus created travels along the back beat, rarefying the air, and
both these, the rarefaction and the condensation, move with the same
rapidity one behind the other.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_193.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 196. and  Fig. 197.</div>
</div>

<p>The tuning-fork of course vibrates a very great many times in a
second, every vibration generating a wave. “Pitch,” in a general sense, is
the number of vibrations per second which constitute a note. For instance,
the note A, the standard pitch consists of four hundred and thirty-five
complete vibrations per second. Concert pitch is slightly higher, for there
are a few more vibrations in the second. The lowest sound pitch is forty
vibrations, the highest forty thousand. “Pitch” may be determined by an
instrument termed the “Syren,” or by a tooth-wheeled apparatus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Syren</span> was invented by Cagniard de Latour. It consists of a
metal cylinder, a tube passes through the bottom, and through the tube air
is blown into the cylinder. On the top a number of holes are drilled, while
just over the cylinder top, almost in contact with it, is a metallic disc, which
rotates upon a vertical axis. The disc is perforated with holes equal in
number to those in the cylinder top, but the holes are not perpendicular,
they slope in opposite directions. So when the air is forced through the
holes in the top of the cylinder it impinges upon one side of the holes in the
rotating disc, and blows it round.</p>

<p>The disc in one revolution will therefore open and shut as many holes
as there are in the disc and cylinder, and the air blown in will escape in so
many puffs—the number of puffs in a given time depending upon the
rapidity of rotation. There is an arrangement to show the number of turns.
By these rotations a sound is produced which rises in pitch as the revolutions
are increased in number.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_194.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 198. &nbsp; Sound Figures. &nbsp; Fig. 199.</div>
</div>

<p>To determine the pitch of a certain sound we must find the number of
times the plate revolves in that time, then we shall have the number of
vibrations per second required to produce the note we desire. The arrangement
working in a notched wheel tells us the number of rotations of the
disc. Successive, and rapidly-successive puffs or beats are heard as the
rotation increases, and at length the two sounds will disappear, and merge
into one, which is perhaps that of the tuning-fork, whose note you require to
find the “pitch” of. By maintaining this rate for a minute or less, and
setting the gear to tell the revolutions, the number will be found marked on
the dial of the apparatus. So by multiplying the number of revolutions of
the disc by the number of the holes, and dividing the product by the number
of seconds during which the disc was in connection with the recording gear,
we shall have the number of vibrations per second necessary to produce the
pitch corresponding to the given sound. The above is the description of
one form of Syren; there are others, which, however, we need not detail.</p>

<p>We have seen that there are certain <em>nodal points</em>, or resting-places, in
vibrations, and this can easily be shown upon a fiddle-string, from which
paper discs will fall off except on the nodal point, showing that there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
vibration there. The same experiment may be made by means of plates,
which will give us what are termed Chladni’s figures. Suppose we strew a
glass-plate with fine sand, and stroke the edge with a fiddle-bow. The
vibrations of the plates will make certain patterns, and cast the sand upon
those points of repose to form nodal lines in various directions. The plates
must, of course, be held or fastened, and a variety of <em>sound figures</em> may be
produced. (<i>See</i> figs. 198 and 199.)</p>

<p>The relation between the number of segments on the plate and the pitch
of the note, can be ascertained by using a circular plate clamped in the
centre. “If the finger on the plate and the fiddle-bow are one-eighth of
the circumference apart, the fundamental note will be produced. If one-sixteenth
apart, the higher octave will be heard.”</p>

<p>Sensitive flames will detect air vibrations, and flames can also be made
to sing. Sensitive flames were discovered by Mr. Barrett, who noticed the
effect a shrill note had upon a gas flame from a tapering jet. The flame
was a very long one (fourteen inches), and when the sound was produced it
shortened at once, while the upper part expanded like a fan; the same
effects, in a less marked degree, were observable when the shrill sound was
prolonged from a distance of forty feet. Professor Tyndall was immediately
interested in this discovery, and in January 1867 he lectured upon
it at the Royal Institution.</p>

<p>If any one wish to try the experiment, a piece of glass tubing should be
obtained, and let the mouth be tapered down to a small orifice one-sixteenth
of an inch in diameter. Then when the highest pressure is on for the
evening, light the gas and sound a shrill whistle. The flame will sink down
and spread out. The illuminating power may thus be increased, and many
experiments may be made. For instance, if a person be in the room and
try to read, he will probably not be able to do so at a little distance; but if
his friend whistle to the gas it will so expand itself as to enable him to read,
so long as the whistle lasts.</p>

<p>A very ingenious burglar-detector was made upon the principle of the
sensitive flame, which expands at a noise and heats a welded plate of gold,
silver, and platinum. The plate swerves aside, the metals being unequally
affected by heat, and as it is connected with a battery, rings a bell by
electricity. A small high flame has been made sensitive to the chinking
of coin, or even to the ticking of a watch. We will now give some explanation,
derived partly from Professor Tyndall, of the cause of sensitive flames.</p>

<p>A sensitive flame is one just on the point of “roaring,” and about to
change its aspect. “It stands,” says Tyndall, “on the edge of a precipice.
The proper sound pushes it over.... We bring it to the verge of falling,
and the sonorous pulses precipitate what was already imminent.” The
flame is in a state of vibration, so sounds being vibrations, practically
increase the pressure; and the flame acknowledges the pressure thus
invisibly applied by air waves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Singing Flames</span> are produced by burning hydrogen in a tube; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
musical note is thus produced in the same way as the air causes a note in
an organ pipe. Faraday attributed the sound to rapid vibration caused by
successive explosions of the burning gas. The Gas Harmonicon has been
made on this principle. The air, being heated in the glass tube, ascends,
and the flame is thus permitted to come up more forcibly in the tube; so
violent agitation results when the air tries to get into the opening above.
The size of the flame and its position in the tube will give a certain note
which will be the same note as the air would emit if in a pipe, for the
vibrations give the sound.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Wheatstone has shown by experiment how sound can be
transmitted by placing a rod on a musical-box, and carrying the rod through
the ceiling. When a guitar or violin was placed upon the rod, the sounds
of the musical-box were distinctly heard in the upper room. A <em>Phantom
Band</em> can be made by connecting certain instruments with others being

<p class="hang">DERIVATION OF ELECTRICITY—SEALING-WAX EXPERIMENT—THE
ELECTROPHORUS—LEYDEN JAR—POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE—THE
ELECTROSCOPE—ELECTRIC MACHINES.</p>


<p>We have now briefly and of course imperfectly reviewed the phenomena of
Vibration, as exemplified in what we term Heat, Light, and Sound. We
now come to a most mysterious servant of mankind, as mysterious as any
Djinn of romance; viz., <span class="smcap">Electricity</span>.</p>

<p>The term Electricity is derived from the Greek word <em>electron</em>, meaning
“amber”; because from amber the properties of what we call “Electricity”
were first discovered. Six hundred years before the Christian Era, Thales
wrote concerning the attraction which amber, when rubbed, possessed for
light and dry bodies. But it is to an Englishman named Gilbert that we
owe the word “Electricity,” which he derived from the Greek, and in his
works (about 1600 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>) he discusses the force of the so-called “fluid.”
Otto von Guerike, of “air-pump” celebrity, and many other philosophers
after him, continued the investigation of the subject. At the beginning of
the last century great attention was paid to the Electric Machine. The
Leyden Jar was, as its name denotes, discovered by Muschenbrock, of Leyden,
(though the honour was disputed). Franklin made the first lightning conductor
in 1760. Volta and Galvani, to whose invention we owe “Voltaic Electricity”
and “Galvanism,” and Faraday in more modern times gave a great
impetus to electrical science. The great part that electricity has been
playing in the domestic history of the world since Faraday’s lamented death,
is probably known to the youngest of our readers. What the future of this
agent may be we can only guess, but even now we may regard electricity
as only in its infancy.</p>

<p>There are few scientific studies more attractive to the general reader
than electricity, and few admit of more popular demonstration. The success
of the late electrical exhibition in Paris, and its successor in London at the
present time, are proofs of the interest taken in this great and mysterious
agent whose origin we are in ignorance of, and of whose nature and powers
we are daily discovering more and more, and finding there is still an
immense field for its application.</p>

<p>Some fundamental facts regarding electricity may very easily be
studied with the assistance of every-day objects at hand. Amber was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
first substance to show attraction when rubbed, but Gilbert found out that
glass and sealing-wax, etc., possessed like properties with amber.</p>

<p>If we rub a stick of sealing-wax with a piece of cloth, we shall see
that it will attract some small fragments of paper placed near it. Nothing
is easier than to construct a small pendulum to show with perfect clearness
the phenomenon of electric attraction. A piece of iron is fixed on a
wooden pedestal, and supports a thread of silk, to the end of which is
fastened a little ball cut out of a piece of cork. The stick of sealing-wax
after being rubbed with the cloth will attract the ball as shown in fig. 200.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 200.—Sealing-wax attracting a piece of cork.</div>
</div>

<p>By means of a piece of paper we can produce a spark. I take a large,
strong sheet of drawing paper, heat it very thoroughly, and lay it on a wooden
table. I rub it with a perfectly dry hand, or with a piece of woollen material
until it adheres to the table. That done, I place a bunch of keys in the
centre of the sheet of paper, which I raise, lifting it by two corners. If at
this moment any one touches the bunch of keys with his finger, a bright
spark will be elicited. The metal is charged with the electricity developed
on the paper; if the weather is dry, and the paper thoroughly heated several
times, the spark may attain nearly an inch in length.</p>

<p>We can easily construct other electrical apparatus. For instance, an
“Electrophorus,” or instrument for obtaining electricity by means of induction,
or a Leyden jar, can both be made at home. Let us proceed to
construct the former, of which we give an illustration (fig. 201).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>We take a lacquered tea-tray about a foot long, and cut out a sheet of
thick wrapping paper, so that it will lie over all the level portion of the tray.
At each side of this sheet of paper we fix two bands of paper, as in the
illustration (fig. 201), so as to serve as handles. The tea-tray should be
placed upon two tumblers to support it and to insulate it, glass being a “non-conductor.”
(We will speak of conductors and non-conductors presently.)
We have now our Electrophorus made ready for action; let us proceed to see
how it will act.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_199.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 201—Simple Electrophorus.</div>
</div>

<p>First, rub the thick packing paper over a hot fire or a stove, and the
friction must be continued for some time, until the paper has become
thoroughly dry, and as hot as possible without charring. When this has
been accomplished, place it quickly upon a wooden table, and rub it rapidly
and energetically with a clothes’ brush, dry and hard as can be obtained.
Place the paper upon the tray; touch the tray with the knuckle, and draw
away the paper by the handles fixed to it (<i>see</i> fig. 201); a spark will result.
Then if the paper be replaced upon the tray, and the hand again presented,
the same result will follow. This experiment may be repeated five or six
times, at least, with success.</p>

<p>We have in this tea-tray and its paper covering a real electric machine.
How can we manage to provide a Leyden jar to contain our electricity?
Nothing is more easy. Let us take a tumbler and partly fill it with shot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
insert into the glass a tea-spoon, and if all the articles are quite dry we
shall possess a Leyden jar.</p>

<p>To charge the jar we have thus provided we must work the Electrophorus
we have already described. While one person lifts off the paper as
directed, another must hold the glass filled with shot close to the edge of
the tray, and touch the corner with the tea-spoon; the spark will then enter
the “jar” or tumbler. We can thus charge the jar as we please, and by
presenting the finger as in the illustration (fig. 202), we shall obtain a discharge
from it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 202.—A Leyden jar.</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Louis Figuier, in his “<cite>Merveilles de la Science</cite>,” relates that Wollaston,
meeting one of his friends one evening in the streets of London,
drew from his pocket a copper thimble, and proceeded to turn it into a
microscopic pile.<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>In order to do this he removed the bottom of the thimble, flattened it
with a stone, so as to bring the two internal surfaces about on a line with
each other, then placed between the copper surfaces a small strip of zinc,
which was not in contact with the copper, owing to the interposition of a
little sealing-wax. He then placed it in a glass cup, previously filled with
the contents of a small phial of water, acidulated with sulphuric acid. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
next wound round the strip of zinc and its copper covering a piece of
platinum wire, the wire becoming red through the electricity developed in
the pile. The dimensions of this platinum wire were extremely small; it
was only 30/1000 of an inch in diameter, and 1/30 of an inch in length. By
reason of its small dimensions it could not only be reddened, but fused
by the little battery.</p>

<p>Thus Wollaston’s friend, who was a witness of the experiment, was able
to light a tinder at the red wire. In this little battery of Wollaston’s
the copper enveloped the strip of zinc in every part; that is to say, the
negative element was on a higher surface than the positive metal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_201.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 203.-A simple compass.</div>
</div>

<p>After considering Electricity, it is not impossible to approach the study
of Magnetism, and even to construct a mariner’s compass. We shall find the
method of doing so by borrowing an interesting passage from the “<cite>Magasin
Pittoresque</cite>.” Let us take a small cork and pass through it an ordinary
knitting-needle (fig. 203), which we have already magnetized by placing it
N.S., rubbing it gently, and always in the same direction, with one of those
little iron magnets with which children amuse themselves. After the needle
has been passed through the cork, we also fix into it a sewing-needle, or
rather a pin, the point of which rests in one of the little holes in the upper
part of the thimble. In order to balance the magnetised needle, we thrust a
match into both sides of the cork, as shown in the illustration, and fasten to
the ends of each a ball of wax. Thus the needle, the balls, and the pin are
all balanced at once, so that the contrivance has the appearance of the illustration.</p>

<p>As it is very important that with such a sensitive instrument any
agitation of the air should be avoided, the thimble must be placed at the
bottom of a common earthen pan, <span class="smcap lowercase">B D T</span>, which should be covered over with
a piece of glass, <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span>. To graduate the compass a circle is described on a piece
of paper. On this dial we trace the divisions sufficiently close only at the
north extremity of the needle, and the paper is fixed underneath, as in
fig. 203. Then we fix a piece of wax at the end of the match pointing <span class="smcap lowercase">N.</span>,
opposite the northern extremity of the needle inside the basin. In this way
we have a very useful and inexpensive compass.</p>

<p>We may also magnetize a fine sewing-needle, and grease it by rubbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
it with a little suet. It is then capable of floating on the surface of water
running in the direction of the north pole. We might go on multiplying
indefinitely examples of physical experiments without apparatus, but we
have probably already given a sufficient number to aid our readers in
imagining others.</p>

<p>We have now in a simple manner shown how we can easily produce
electricity. We may understand that electrical phenomena are produced—(1)
friction between different bodies; (2) by placing bodies which differ in
contact; (3) by the transition of bodies from one condition to another; (4)
by chemical changes; (5) by animals. The two first, and the fourth, are
the most usual causes.</p>

<p>We know that certain substances when rubbed with silk or wool
acquire the property of attracting other substances. But in the case of a
rod of glass or stick of wax, the attraction will only be perceived when the
rubbing has been applied. But metal will behave differently. Any part of
the metal rod will continue to attract. So metals are <span class="smcap">Conductors</span> of
electricity; while glass, wax, silk, amber, sulphur, etc., are <em>bad</em>, or <span class="smcap">Non-Conductors</span>.
Metals are the best conductors we have, but trees, plants,
liquids, and the bodies of animals, including men, are all good conductors of
electricity. Dry air is a bad conductor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_202.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 204.—Attraction and repulsion.</div>
</div>

<p>There are two kinds of electricity, known as positive
and negative (<em>plus</em> or <em>minus</em>), vitreous or resinous. We saw
in fig. 200 that we can attract a small ball of pith or cork
by a piece of sealing-wax rubbed with flannel. If we then
present a glass rod rubbed with silk to it, it will be equally
attracted, but will be at once repelled; and after being so
repelled, if we put the wax to it, it will be attracted to the
sealing-wax again. So wax at first attracts then repels the
ball, and so does glass, but either will attract the ball if presented
alternately (fig. 204). The reason for this is as follows :—</p>

<p>When we have rubbed the glass with silk, we charge it with positive
electricity, and when the rod touches the ball, the latter imbibes that
electricity, and flies away from the glass rod. The sealing-wax imparts
negative electricity in the same way.</p>

<p>The law is, that bodies charged with the same kind of electricity <em>repel</em>
each other, and those containing the opposite kinds <em>attract</em> each other.
Positive <em>repels</em> positive; negative <em>repels</em> negative. But positive <em>attracts</em>
negative, and negative <em>attracts</em> positive. Opposite electricities unite, and so
neutralize each other that no effect is perceived; but it must be borne in
mind that all bodies possess both electricities in some quantity, greater
or less. By rubbing we separate these electricities, the rubber becoming
negative, the rub<em>bee</em> positive. The friction of glass supplies positive
electricity, and sealing-wax supplies negative electricity, or we can obtain
the same effect by rubbing either with certain material.</p>

<p>The manner in which a body is electrified depends upon its nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
and condition; but we may accept as a general axiom,—but by no means as
a law,—that when two bodies are rubbed together, that which gets the hotter
in the process takes the negative kind of electricity. In the following list
the substances have been so arranged that each is negatively electrified
by those preceding, and positively by those succeeding it. 1, cat’s skin;
2, glass; 3, woollen stuffs; 4, feathers; 5, wood; 6, paper; 7, silk;
8, shellac; 9, rough glass. We append a list of conducting and non-conducting
bodies in their order:—</p>

<p>It should be observed that the degree of value as a conductor or non-conductor
depends somewhat upon the atmosphere. For instance, glass is
an excellent insulator, or non-conductor, when dry, but when wet it changes
to a conductor. So insulators are at times covered with a solution of shell-lac,
or fat, to keep away moisture. We may reasonably conclude that bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
which are good and bad conductors are good and bad conductors of electricity.
Water is a good conductor, air is a bad one; were it otherwise, electricity
would escape from the ground into the air; as it is, the air manages in some
degree to retain the electricity at the surface of bodies, for it is on the surface
that we find the electric “fluid.”</p>

<p>We have mentioned <em>electrical induction</em> in a former experiment with
the tea-tray. We will now explain it more fully, as a consideration of it will
bring us to the <em>electric spark</em>, or lightning, with the account of the discovery
of the <em>Conductor</em> and the <em>Electrical Machine</em>.</p>

<p>Let us look at the illustration next below. <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> is a cylinder
supported on a glass rod, and at each extremity is a small pith ball, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.
The cylinder is in a neutral condition, as is evidenced at first by the pellets
being in a vertical position. But suppose we bring a ball, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, towards the
cylinder. <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> is charged with positive electricity, which attracts the negative
to itself, and so repels the positive away at the opposite side. So the pellet
at one side will be attracted to <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, and the other will fly in an opposite
direction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_204a.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 208.—Induction.</div>
</div>

<p>Let us take another illustration. Here we have a horizontal metal rod,
<i>cc′</i>, insulated on a glass stand. Two balls of
cork are attached at both ends of the rod by
metallic wires. Hold a rod of resin, <i>r</i>, which
has been made negatively electrical, and apply
it to one pair of the cork balls. The positive
electricity will be attracted at <i>c′</i> and the negative
repulsed, and fly away at <i>c</i>. If we remove the
resin the equilibrium will be again established,
and the balls will fall to a vertical position.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_204.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 207.—Electrical induction.</div>
</div>

<p>We can also by drawing off the negative electricity by the finger at <i>c</i>,
while the resin rod is still held to the other side, <i>c′</i>, fill the whole of
the metal rod with the positive electricity when the finger and the resin
have been removed respectively first and last. The balls will then fly in
opposite directions again, in consequence of the repulsion exercised by the
positive poles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>The “Electrophore,” or “<em>Electrophorus</em>,” we have already learned to
make for ourselves, as also the Leyden Jar. But we give cuts of them.
The former is very simple, and can be made by mixing two parts of
shell-lac and one of turpentine, and pouring the mixture
upon a metal plate. If this be rubbed with a cat’s skin
when dry, and a metal cover with a glass handle be
placed upon it, it will be found that the positive and
negative electricity are collected on the lower and upper
surfaces of the plate respectively, and can be drawn
away with a spark as before, and made use of.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_205a.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 209.—Electrophorus.</div>
</div>

<p>The Leyden Jar requires a little more detailed description, as it is to it
we are indebted for our Battery. It is a common glass bottle or jar, coated
both inside and out with tinfoil nearly as high as the shoulder, <i>a</i> <i>a</i>. The
mouth should be firmly closed with a bung of wood, <i>g</i> <i>g</i>; a hole should be bored
in the bung, through which a brass rod is tightly pushed. The rod, too, is
topped by a brass knob, and a brass chain is attached to the
other extremity. The interior of the tinfoil receives positive
electricity, and the exterior negative when the jar is charged
from the “Electrophorus.” To discharge the jar and create a
<em>shock</em> it is necessary to put one hand on the outside, and the
other on the knob of the jar. A brilliant spark and a severe
shock will result if the jar has been fully charged. It is as
well to be cautious when trying this experiment. The effect
of the shock may be felt by any number of persons joining
hands, if one at one end of the row, and one at the other
end, touch the knob and the outside of the jar simultaneously.</p>

<div class="figright" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 210.—The Leyden Jar.</div>
</div>

<p>This electric discharge is lightning in miniature, and it is to Benjamin
Franklin that the world is indebted for the discovery. The philosopher was
greatly interested in the science of Electricity and, having retired from
business, he devoted himself to the consideration of thunderstorms. He
wrote a treatise to show that points drew off electricity, and that electricity
and lightning were similar. He urged that metallic rods might be attached
to ships and buildings, so that during thunderstorms, or at other times, the
electricity might be harmlessly carried into the ground. This suggestion he
made without being able to explain <em>why</em> points did carry off electricity
without a spark. The reason is because there is no place to store it; it runs
away at once, without having time to collect, as in a ball.</p>

<p>Franklin made one or two experiments before his renowned kite-flying
arrangement, which convinced him that electricity was by no means an agent
to be played with. He endeavoured to kill a turkey by electricity, but by
incautious handling of the jars in which the “fluid” was stored, he discharged
them, and describes the result: “The flash was very great, and the
crack was as loud as a pistol; yet my senses being instantly gone, I neither
saw the one nor heard the other, nor did I feel the stroke on my hand,
though I afterwards found it raised a round swelling where the fire entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
as big as half a pistol bullet.” On a subsequent occasion he was again
struck senseless while endeavouring to administer a shock to a paralytic
patient.</p>

<p>It was not until June 1752 that Franklin made the experiment with
the kite, which resulted in such great discoveries. He made his kite of a
silk pocket-handkerchief, and he fixed a pointed rod upon the upright portion
of the frame at the top; the string ended in a foot or so of silk, which
was held by the philosopher, and to the end of the hempen portion of the
string a large key was tied. For some time, notwithstanding the approach
of most unmistakable thunder-clouds, his patience was tried. But at last the
strands of the hempen string began to bristle up, and soon after, when
Franklin applied his knuckle to the key, a spark was obtained. The great
discovery was made. Franklin subsequently obtained lightning in his own
house, and performed several experiments with it.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_206.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 211.—The Electroscope.</div>
</div>

<p>The Electroscope (fig. 211) is an instrument
by which we can ascertain whether electricity is
present or not, and the nature of it. If we bring
an object unelectrified close to the ball or knob
on the top of the glass shade, the two needles,
or strips of gold-leaf, which are often used, will
remain still. But if the body has been electrified
it will communicate the electricity to the rod
inside, and attract to itself the fluid of opposite
quality; the same kind of electricity then is in
action in the gold-leaf or needles, and they fly
apart—repel each other. Supposing that positive
electricity were first communicated, we can
cause the contraction of the leaves or wires by
applying a negative kind, which, meeting the
positive, neutralizes it, and the wires collapse.</p>

<p>If the electricity with which the instrument is charged be positive, by
approaching the baton to the ball, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, we shall see the wires diverge more
than before, and they will finally be discharged by the knobs within. If the
electricity be contrary to that in the baton, the wires will approach each
other, but by gradually withdrawing the baton they will again separate, and
even to a greater distance than before.</p>

<p>The Electric Machine is shown in the illustration (fig. 212). It consists
of a large plate of glass fixed upon a glass stand, between wooden supports.
The handle is of glass; two pairs of rubbers are fastened above and below;
the plate is turned between them, and becomes “positively” electrified.
The rubbers are covered with leather and stuffed with horsehair, <span class="smcap lowercase">DD</span>, and
press very tightly against the glass, so that the friction is constant. The
rubbers are covered with an amalgam made of mercury, zinc, and tin,
two parts of the first to one each of the others. A chain (of metal) connects
the machine with the ground. The conductors, <span class="smcap lowercase">PP</span>, are united by a cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>-piece,
<span class="smcap lowercase">Q</span>, and sustained upon glass supports. At the end of the conductors are
two curved rods, <span class="smcap lowercase">CC</span>, which are provided with points to take the electricity
from the plate, but do not touch it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_207.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 212.—The Electric Machine.</div>
</div>

<p>The electricity is thus stored in the insulated conductors as the machine
is turned. The negative portion is carried into the ground by the chain
from the rubbers, while the positive electricity is retained. The longer we
turn the more we shall obtain, and the quantity is measured by an electric
pendulum on one of the conductors, which flies out by degrees as the charge
increases, and indicates its power by means of a needle it works upon an
ivory index.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to make an electric machine out of a glass bottle.
This will furnish the glass cylinder. If a stick be run through it (for which
purpose a hole must be drilled in the bottom of the bottle), a handle can be
fixed, and the bottle mounted on a stand. A wash-leather cushion, stuffed, can
be so arranged that it will press against the bottle as it is turned; a piece of
silk should be permitted to hang from the cushion frame over the glass. A
conductor may be made from a piece of wood neatly rounded and smoothed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
and coated with tinfoil. The ends should be rounded like “knobs.” Stick
pins in to collect the electricity (and it will be readily obtained). The cushion
should of course be well smeared with amalgam. From this, as well as from
the glass-plate machine, the “positive” electricity can be drawn off and
stored in a Leyden jar, and then discharged by the “discharging rod,” which
is represented on the cut. It may have one or two handles, and one knob
is placed outside the jar, the other near the ball surmounting it. The glass
being a non-conductor saves the operator, and some long sparks and loud
reports may be obtained.</p>

<p>The Electric Machine is always assumed to give off <em>positive</em> electricity.</p>

<p>Sir William Armstrong’s Electric Machine is a mode of obtaining
electricity by moist steam. The design is Armstrong’s, and Professor Faraday
subsequently went into all the conditions to produce the “fluid” by the
friction of steam. The machine was something like a small boiler supported
on glass legs. A row of nozzles was fixed upon the escape pipe so as to
create a great velocity and friction in the escaping steam. Round the nozzles
was a box of cold water, for that fluid was found necessary for the production
of electricity as demonstrated by Professor Faraday. The steam rushed
against a row of points attached to the prime conductor of an electric
machine, and the electricity of the steam was thus given off to the conductor.
There are many other forms of electric machines, but it will serve no purpose
to detail them.</p>

<p>The <em>Electric Battery</em> (<i>see</i> fig. 206) is formed by a collection of Leyden
jars. The inside and outside coatings are connected in a box divided into
partitions lined with tinfoil. The rods of the jars are also connected, as in
the illustration, by brass rods, and when this battery is charged people should
be careful how they handle it, for a shock may be produced which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
cause serious injury, if not death. The battery can be charged from the
machine by a chain fastened to the central ball, while a second chain connects
the exterior of the box and all the outside of the jars,
by means of the handle, to the ground.</p>

<p>When electricity is at rest it is termed “static
electricity,” and when in motion “dynamic” electricity.
The latter treats of electric currents which can be sent
through wires or chains. We can keep this current
moving by means of a machine, and the battery called
a Voltaic battery, from Volta. We will describe it
presently. Electric currents can be measured, for they
may be of different strengths according to the battery,
and they are measured by the <span class="smcap">Galvanometer</span>. Electricity
can therefore be transferred and carried by the
conducting substances, and much heat will be engendered as the “electric
fluid” passes along a wire. Lightning frequently fuses bell-wires as it
passes, and when we touch upon Galvanism or Dynamical Electricity we
shall hear more about it.</p>

<p>By the Electric Machine we can obtain some very powerful currents of
electricity; we can produce many pleasing effects, and perform a number
of experiments, such as making balls or figures of pith dance, and several
other easy and entertaining tricks, which will be found in books more specially
devoted to the entertainment of young people.</p>

<div class="caption"> Fig. 215.—Leyden Jar.</div>
</div>

<p>We have now given some explanation of the manner in which electrical
phenomena can be produced,—viz., by the Electric Machine and by the Leyden
Jar,—but we must not expect to find any electricity inside any charged body.
It has been proved that all the electricity is upon the surface of bodies, even
if in varying quantity, and that equal quantities of electricity are always
produced when bodies are excited by friction, but the <em>kinds</em> are different.
The rubbing body is of one kind, the body rubbed another, and consequently
the forces neutralize each other. The two forces or kinds of electricity we
have seen repel or attract each other, and we can imagine the farther they
are apart the less will be the force, and the <em>rate of diminution of force</em>, according
to distance, is ascertained by an ingenious apparatus called a “Torsion”
Electromoter, which was constructed by Coulomb, and was frequently used by
Faraday.</p>

<p>Perhaps some people may not be aware of the term “torsion.” It
means twisting, and “the torsion of a thread suspended vertically is the force
tending to twist the lower extremity when the upper end is turned through
an angle.” This instrument is really an Electromoter, and is not considered
suited to beginners, and it is scarcely accurate in its workings. We need
not therefore describe it in detail. There are some excellent Electromoters,
the Elliott being, we believe, the best for use. A full and detailed description
of the Quadrant Electromoter will be found in Mr. Gordon’s treatise on
Electricity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Recapitulation of foregoing Chapter.</em> So far, we have seen there is
electricity in everything, although some bodies are termed conductors and
others non-conductors; though, as in applying the terms heat and cold, we
must remember that no body is entirely devoid of electricity, and no body
is therefore an absolute <em>non</em>-conductor any more than any object is absolutely
devoid of heat. Faraday, indeed, was of opinion that “conduction and
insulation are only extreme degrees of one common condition”; they are
identical both in principle and action, except that in <em>conduction</em> an effect
common to both is raised to the highest degree, and in the case of insulation
it occurs in an almost insensible quantity.</p>

<p>We have also read of positive and negative electricities, and we must not
fancy there is any particular reason for this distinction. It was Du Fay,
whom we have mentioned, who gave the names “vitreous” and “resinous”
to the two kinds, as one was developed by rubbing glass, and the other by
rubbing resin. But, as shown by our experiments, either kind of electricity
can be excited in glass or sealing-wax, and both kinds are produced at once.
You cannot get “positive” without negative electricity. “Positive” is the term
applied to the kind produced by rubbing glass with silk or wool; “negative”
is the term applied to the kind developed by rubbing sealing-wax, but the
kind developed by friction depends on the rubbing substance and certain
conditions.</p>

<p>Bodies charged with the same electricity repel; if charged with different
kinds they attract each other. The more readily displaced particles when
bodies are rubbed become negatively electrified as a rule.</p>

<p>Similar electricities repel each other with a force inversely proportional
to the squares of the distance between their centres, as established by
Coulomb. So if the space between any two similarly electrified bodies be
reduced by say <em>one-half</em>, the force of the repulsion will be increased <em>four</em>
times. The rule for attraction is similar; so when two bodies are charged
with opposite electricities, and the distance between them is increased, the
attractive force is diminished in proportion as the square of the distance
between them. Many confirmations of this theory were made by the
late friend of our boyhood, Sir W. Snow Harris, and published in the <cite>Philosophical
Transactions</cite>.</p>

<p>The following full list of conductors and non-conductors (copied from
Professor Noad’s Text-book of Electricity, and compared with De La Rive’s
Treatise) may be useful:—</p>

<p>There are, as we know, two kinds of electricity, the <em>static</em> and <em>dynamic</em>;
and when the latter state is <em>instantaneous</em>, it is referred to as the “electric
discharge,” which occurs when opposite electricities seek each other, and the
bodies return to a state of equilibrium or neutralization. “These bodies, if
<em>insulated</em>, obtain no more electricity after the spark has passed; but if there
be a constant source of negative electricity supplying one, and a constant
source of negative electricity supplying the other, there will be a succession
of sparks; and if they communicate by a conductor there will be, through
this conductor, an uninterrupted neutralization of a continual reunion of the
two electricities, and this is what is termed the continuous dynamic state or
electric current” (De la Rive).</p>

<p class="hang">VELOCITY OF ELECTRICITY—EXPERIMENTS—THE ELECTRIC EGG—FORCE
OF THE ELECTRIC SPARK.</p>


<p>We are now acquainted with many facts concerning electricity, and have
seen that electrical phenomena can be produced by the Electric Machine and
the Leyden Jar. (An insulating stool—a stool with glass legs—is a very
desirable adjunct for those who wish to experiment with the machine).
Glass is a great insulator, or non-conductor, as a Russian philosopher found
to his cost. He had an iron lightning-conductor from his house into his
room, the end not connected with the earth but with a glass. One day the
lightning came down the rod and reached the glass; had a communication
been made with the earth by a chain, or directly, no mischief would have
ensued. As it happened, however, the current was checked by the glass,
and immediately darted towards him; it struck him in the head, and killed
the poor man on the spot. If no insulating stool were used, the body charged
would be discharged upon contact with the ground.</p>

<p>The velocity of electricity is very great, and experiments have frequently
been made. Wheatstone undertook to ascertain the speed of the
electric fluid, and the instrument he employed he called a “Chronoscope.”
He caused a mirror to revolve with enormous velocity, and measured the
speed by the vibrations of air, which produced a certain note by the
same motive power. (We know already that certain notes are produced by
a certain number of vibrations per second.) Wheatstone’s Chronoscope
consisted of this mirror, in front of which was placed a circular block of wood,
in which, in a row, were set six wires carrying small knobs; round these and
over the wood he put an insulating varnish. A Leyden jar was connected
outside with the first knob; between the second and third a quarter of a mile
of copper wire was coiled, and a like length of wire between the fourth and
fifth; the inside of the Leyden jar was then connected with the last knob, and
the spark passed; it ran from knob to knob over the long coils of wire. If
all the flashes over the wire and knobs occurred simultaneously the mirror
would show them side by side; if not, as the mirror turned a trifle, the difference
would be observed. The mirror did show a slight retardation in
the passage of the flash, and from certain measurements and calculations
Wheatstone estimated the velocity of the spark to be 288,000 miles a second.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
This rate will carry electricity round the earth in about a twelfth of a second,
a rate Puck never dreamed of when he promised to “put a girdle round the
earth in forty minutes.”</p>

<p>But it appeared from investigations subsequently made that it was not
possible to express the velocity of electricity with any certainty, and a
number of experiments were made as per the following table, with very
different results. Sir William Thomson and Faraday endeavoured to
account for these stupendous discrepancies, and the principles of retardation
of electricity were established. The differences are shown below:—</p>

<p>To account for the comparatively low velocities of the cables, Faraday
proved that they act very much as a Leyden jar acts; that is, it takes time
to fill, as it were, and to discharge them, the wire coating of the cable in air
acting like the outer coating of the jar or the water in the case of an immersed
cable, and the retardation observed is owing to resistance of conduction, and
depends upon the way in which the electrical impulses traverse the wire.
“There is a long, gradual swell, and still more gradual subsidence of the
electric current, and the length of time that elapses between the initial
impulse and the attainment of maximum strength, is proportional to the
square of the length of the line.”</p>

<p>The duration of the electric spark has been calculated at the 1/24000
part of a second, but Professor Tyndall regards this as the longest or nearly
the longest time it is perceptible; the <em>shortest</em> time is almost inconceivable.
The brightest portion of a spark has been ascertained to last only forty-six
millionths of a second, and certain experiments were made to ascertain the
actual duration with various numbers of Leyden jars. It was discovered by
Messrs. Lucas and Cuzin, by an application of the Vernier, with batteries
consisting variously of two to eight jars, and obtained the following results<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>—</p>

<p>“So,” adds the writer, “the duration (of spark) increases in proportion
with the number of the jars. It increases also with the striking distance, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
is independent of the diameter of the balls or globes between which the
spark strikes.”</p>

<p>Many examples might be given of the <em>spark discharge</em> of the electric
current. This form is seen in the blue line extending between the knob of
a machine and the hand, and the duration of a spark with a jar charged
with an induction coil is stated by Professor Rood to vary, but the brightest
portion with a jar of 114 square inches only existed for the 175th <em>billionth</em>
of a second, and with a smaller surface was much shorter. Such a spark
may be conducted to a plate of gunpowder and will not ignite it, because
the time of the duration of the “fire” is not sufficiently long; the powder
will be scattered, but not ignited. If, however, a partly non-conducting
medium be interposed between the jar and the powder, so that the spark be
retarded a little, the gunpowder will be fired.</p>

<p>While speaking of electric discharge we may remark upon the beautiful
effect of lightning. These discharges are sometimes miles long, and by
the return stroke from the cloud may kill a person a long way from the
actual discharge. This phenomenon was illustrated by Viscount Mahon in
1779, in a very interesting book on the principles of electricity.</p>

<p>There are different ways in which the electric discharge shows itself.
We have spoken about the spark discharge which, however, is found to present
very different appearances in varying conditions. Professor Faraday
proved that the colour of the electric sparks showed in air, when obtained with
brass balls, the intense light and blue colour so familiar to all. In nitrogen
they are even bluer. In oxygen again the sparks are much <em>brighter</em> than in
air, but not so <em>brilliant</em>. In hydrogen they become crimson, but the sound
is almost inaudible because of the physical character of the gas. In carbonic
acid gas they are almost the same as in atmospheric air, only more irregular.
In dry muriatic gas they are nearly white and very bright. In coal gas the
colours vary—sometimes being green and sometimes red. Occasionally the
same spark will be red and green at different extremities, and even <em>black</em>
portions have been observed. The density and pressure of the atmosphere
has been proved to exercise considerable influence upon the spark discharge.</p>

<p>The “Brush” discharge is shown in “a series of intermittent discharges
which appear continuous.” This discharge assumes the shape of a fan. “It
is accompanied with a low chattering sound,” which is the result of the
separate and continuous discharges, and Faraday also demonstrated that its
effects varied according to the medium in which it was exhibited.</p>

<p>The effect of the air pressure on electricity may be observed in the
following way:—</p>

<p>If we pass a spark through rarefied air by an apparatus known
as the Electric Egg, we may obtain many curious effects. The “egg”
consists of a glass globe, through which enter two rods with a knob upon each
inside end. The upper rod is moveable, and held in its place by a “cap”
like the lower rod. There is a stop-cock in the lower cap, so that the egg
may be fastened to any plate or stand. When the egg is filled with air, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
electric spark passed into the glass globe has the usual appearance, but as
the air is gradually rarefied by an air-pump, the spark assumes beautiful
forms and colours. As the exhaustion continues, however, we shall find the
spark decreasing in brilliancy, and finally the spark will cease to be visible.
It thus is shown that the colour of the spark depends upon the gaseous
medium and on the material of the conductors, and when the electric spark
is faint this medium can be observed, for nitrogen will produce a blue tinge
and carbonic acid a green; hydrogen gives us a red, as already remarked.
By multiplying the number of eggs and plates of glass, and placing discs of
tinfoil in various shapes at certain distances, many beautiful figures may be
observed when the spark is set free.</p>

<p>Professor Tyndall at the Royal Institution showed a very pretty experiment.
He took a funnel with a very fine bore, and permitted sand to flow
from it as it will in the hour-glass. When he permitted the electric current
to come in contact with the sand, however, it, instead of falling vertically
to the table, spread out fan-like, each grain repelling and being repelled by
its neighbour with an effect very beautiful to see. Luminous effects have
frequently been produced by passing an electric spark through various bodies.
For instance, a lump of sugar can be made quite brilliant in the dark by
passing electricity through it, and there are other substances similarly affected.
Even eggs and some fruits are thus made phosphorescent. The illumination
of the “diamond” covered Leyden jar is familiar to all who ever attended a
lecture on Electricity.</p>

<p>The various effects of the electric discharge need not here be described.
We have witnessed the results of lightning, but even in our laboratory many
pretty little experiments can be made, such as the perforation of a card by
the electric discharge. The chemical effects are various. Decomposition of
water is effected by electricity, and the discharge can also be, and has been
utilized for military purposes, such as employed by Professor Abel in his
fuse, and in his apparatus for firing mines. Experiments at Chatham and
elsewhere have been very successful in the application
of electricity to modern warfare.</p>

<p>We will illustrate one or two of these. A
thick card should be placed, as in the illustration
(fig. 216), between two insulated points, and
to the lower portion of the apparatus a chain
be attached, held in the hand, and wound round
the Leyden jar. If then the knob of the jar
and the knob above the upper point be brought
together, the spark will pass through the card.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_215.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"> Fig. 216.—Experiment with card.</div>
</div>

<p>In the same manner a glass may be perforated
if the current be stronger. Of course
the whole apparatus—and particularly the plate—must
be quite dry, and it will be better to put a drop of oil under the
upper needle point so as to prevent the electricity spreading over the glass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
The glass will be found pierced by the electric spark when the Leyden jar
is brought into requisition (fig. 217).</p>

<p>It was at one time contended that the sudden expansion of the air by
the electric spark caused heat to be generated, and a thermometer was
invented by Kinnersley to show this. The illustration (fig. 218) will explain
it. When the electric spark passed between the balls in the large tube the
water rose in the smaller. But the immediate return of the water to its level
showed that the disturbance was only mechanical, and not owing to heat.</p>

<p class="hang">GALVANI’S DISCOVERY—THE FROGS ELECTRIFIED—EXPERIMENTS—VOLTA’S
PILE—THE TEST—ITS USEFULNESS—FARADAY’S “RESEARCHES.”</p>


<p>Galvanism owes its origin to the researches of Galvani, the celebrated professor
of Bologna, and we are indebted to what was a mere “accident” for
our knowledge of this science.</p>

<p>Before Galvani’s time there had been many instances adduced of animal
electricity. The Rev. F. Lunn, in his article upon Electricity,<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> mentions the
fact that fire streamed from the head of Servius Tullius when about seven
years of age, and Virgil we know refers to flame emitted by the hair of
Ascanius—</p>

<p class="center">
“Lambere flamma comas, et circum tempora pasci”;
</p>

<p>and if any one will comb his or her hair with an ebonite comb in the dark,
with what is sometimes called an “india-rubber comb,” the hair will give out
sufficient light to enable the operator to see himself in a looking-glass. In
olden days it is related that a lady when touched with a linen cloth emitted
sparks, and the same phenomenon was observable when a bookseller at Pisa
removed his under-garment or vest (De Castro). We are all aware of the
electricity of the cat and of certain fishes (<i>see</i> Electricity of Animals in sequel),
and “torpedos.” Galvani had of course a knowledge of this property, and
had occupied himself for some time making experiments upon the electricity
in animals. He was not in his laboratory that day when the great discovery
was made by means of the edible frog.</p>

<p>Galvani’s wife was just then in a very delicate state of health, and in
accordance with usage had been ordered soup made from frogs. It is related
that some of these animals, ready skinned, were lying upon the laboratory
table, for the Professor had been just previously investigating the question
of what he opined was “animal” electricity; that is, he fancied that muscular
motion depended upon that subtle force.</p>

<p>The electric machine was in action, and one of the attendants happening
to approach or touch one of the frogs, the man as well as Madame Galvani
observed that the limbs were violently agitated. Galvani was at once informed
of this, and he made repeated experiments, which showed him that the
convulsive movements only took place when a spark was drawn from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
prime conductor of the electric machine, and while the nerve was touched by
a conductor. Galvani then suspended a number of frogs to a railing by
metal hooks, with a view to experiment upon them with atmospherical
electricity. But the frogs’ limbs were again agitated when no electricity was
apparent, and Galvani after some consideration came to the conclusion that
the movement was owing to the position the animals assumed with reference
to the metallic bodies. Thus when muscle and nerve were in contact with
metallic bodies and connected by metal, the movements of the limbs were
observable, and the greater the surface contact the greater was the convulsion.
The philosopher next tried various metals, and discovered that the most
powerful combination was zinc and silver.</p>

<p>Galvani, in 1791, published his discovery and his theory that the body
acted as a Leyden jar, different parts being in a different state of electricity.
No sooner were his deductions published than all Europe was in a ferment,
and philosophers of all nations were discussing it. Fowler, Valli, Robison,
Wells, Humboldt, etc., all were deeply interested, but none of them appear
to have arrived at so correct conclusions as did Volta, the physician of Pavia.
“Wherever frogs were to be found,” says Du Bois Reymond, “and where
two different kinds of metal could be procured, everybody was anxious to
see the mangled limbs of frogs brought to life in this wonderful way. Physiologists
believed that at length they should realize their visions of a vital
power, and physicians thought no cure was impossible.”</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the popular theory, Volta, in his letters to Carallo,
while giving a full and clear account of the discovery made by Galvani and
his own experiments, attacked and finally defeated the Professor. Volta
quite upset Galvani’s Leyden-jar theory; Volta says that it was by accident
that Mr. Galvani discovered the phenomenon, and by which he was more
astonished than he ought to have been. Volta’s letters will be found in the
<cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite> of the Royal Society (in French), and he attributes
the effect to the metals which produced a small amount of electricity. He
found that the nerve was acted upon on even parts of a muscle laid upon
two different metals, and if those were united, a contraction took place.</p>

<p>“Many experiments were made in all parts of Europe,” says Doctor
Roget, and “an opinion had been very prevalent that the real source of the
power developed existed in the muscle and nerve which formed part of the
circuit, and that the metals which composed the other part acted merely as
the conductors by which that agency was transferred from the one to the
other of these animal structures. But the discoveries of Volta dispelled the
error, by proving that the sources of power were derived from the galvanic
properties of the metals themselves when combined with certain fluids,” and
decided that this principle was electricity. From this the “general fact”
was deduced—viz., “that when a certain portion of a nerve which is distributed
to any muscle is made part of a galvanic circuit, convulsions, generally of a
violent and convulsive kind, are produced in that muscle.”</p>

<p>Volta at length made the discovery that when two metals were brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
together electricity was developed, and by uniting a disc of copper and one
of zinc, and subjecting them to the test of an Electroscope, he found positive
and negative electricity developed in the zinc and copper respectively; so
Volta came to the conclusion that each metal parted with electricity, and
one became all “positive” and the other all “negative.” But when he came
further to consider the possibility of building up a “pile” of these metal
discs sufficiently strong to produce electric effects, he found that if his theory
were correct he would lose from one side of the metal all he would gain
from the other, and therefore he could never obtain more than the slight
effect he had originally produced.</p>

<p>This was at first a difficulty apparently impossible to remove. It was
so self-evident that the discs of metal, if placed in a pile in a series of pairs,
would continually exercise like effects to the first pair of discs, that Volta
was puzzled, and for some time he could not arrive at any reasonable solution.
At last it struck him that if he placed between the discs some slow-conducting
substance, the electricity would not pass from disc to disc, and
the force developed or set in motion would be more powerful.</p>

<p>He made the experiment. The result was
the Voltaic pile made in 1800, of which we give
an illustration (fig. 219). A communication on
the subject of Electricity by contact, written by
M. Volta, is to be found in the <cite>Philosophical
Proceedings</cite> for the year 1800.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_219.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 219.—Voltaic Pile.</div>
</div>

<p>Volta constructed the pile which bears his
name, on the assumption that “every two
heterogeneous bodies form a galvanic circle or
arc in which electricity is generated.” The
“pile” consisted of a number of discs of zinc
and copper separated by discs of card soaked in
water. This combination of metals separated
by a bad conductor, developed considerable
electricity, the “positive” going to the zinc at
the top, and the “negative” turning to the
opposite end. By touching the zinc and copper
extremities simultaneously with wetted fingers
we shall experience a shock. “I don’t need
your frog,” Volta said, when he had proved his
theory; “give me two metals and a moist rag,
and I will produce your animal electricity. Your frog is nothing but a
moist conductor, and in this respect it is inferior to my wet rag!”</p>

<p>After this discovery the theory of animal electricity died away for
many years, till in 1825, Nobili, and afterwards Matteucci, proved the existence
of galvanic currents in muscles.</p>

<p>After Volta had succeeded in obtaining a shock from his “pile,” he
proceeded to the construction of another instrument, or rather apparatus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
which he denominated “Couronne des tasses” (fig. 220). It consisted of a
series of small glasses containing water or a saline solution. He then procured
a number of “metallic arcs,” partly composed of zinc and partly of copper;
these were inserted into the glasses, so that every glass contained the zinc
of one and the copper of another arc, not in contact, but one at the right
hand the other at the left. The electro motion, supposed to be the primary
cause of the galvanic action, was thus produced as well as from the “pile.”
The principle was just the same in both apparatus, the metals being divided
by the water in one case, and by a wet card or cloth in the other.</p>

<p>Volta, in 1800, addressed to the Royal Society his celebrated letter
upon electricity excited by contact of conducting substances, and then the
English philosophers proceeded to make further experiments. It was Fabroni
of Florence who had just before suggested that chemical action was really
the cause of the phenomena exhibited. Sir Humphrey Davy warmly
advocated this theory, and made numerous experiments with the view to
establish it. Nicholson, Carlisle, and Cruickshank also paid great attention
to the subject. Volta, although he had laid the foundation, did not venture
to build upon it. Messrs. Nicholson and Carlisle found the two kinds of
electricity in the pile, the zinc being positive and the silver negative. They
also found that the water was decomposed both in the circuit and in the body
of the pile. Subsequently Cruickshank confirmed Nicholson’s observations,
and made use of what is termed the “trough” apparatus. He found that
hydrogen was emitted from the silver or upper end, and oxygen from the other.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_220.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 220.—Volta’s couronne des tasses.</div>
</div>

<p>These discoveries opened up a wide field. “The power of the pile in
decomposing chemical substances was now established.” Dr. Henry
employed galvanism for analysis, and Sir Humphrey Davy invented new
combinations of substances. He formed a pile of charcoal and zinc, and
found out that a pile could consist of only one metal, different fluids being
applied to the opposite surfaces separated by water, and one fluid “capable
of oxidating the metal, the other of preventing the effect of oxidation.” Soon
after a pile was made of charcoal.</p>

<p>In 1806, Sir H. Davy gave the results of his researches to the world
upon the electro-chemical action of bodies. In the course of his experiments
he found out the chemical constituents of the alkalies, and a surprising
number of new things were brought to light, and chemical science received
a most astonishing ally. Sir W. S. Harris says: “A series of new substances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
were speedily discovered, the existence of which had never before been
imagined. Oxygen, chlorine, and acids were all dragged, as it were, to the
positive pole, while metals, inflammable bodies, alkalies, and earths became
determined to the negative pole of the (galvanic) battery. When wires
connected with each extremity of the new battery were tipped with prepared
and well-pointed charcoal, and the points brought near each other, then
a most intense and pure evolution of light followed, which on separating
the points extended to a gorgeous arc.” So the elements of all bodies were
separated and the composition of their compounds closely investigated.</p>

<p>Michael Faraday threw himself <i lang="it">con amore</i> into the question. He set
about to classify the pile phenomena, and arranged them with appropriate
terms, and in a series of papers, between the years 1830 and 1840 (<cite>see</cite> his
“Experimental Researches”), he explained the chemical effects of voltaic
electricity and electro-magnetic induction. He showed that the electricities
obtainable from the voltaic pile and the electrical machine are essentially
the same in their action. He proved that the theory held respecting the
necessity for the presence of water in electro-chemical composition was
erroneous, and that many other fluids and compounds were equally effective.
We have not space at our disposal to include a digest of his various lectures
and papers. He calculated that as much electricity is employed in holding
the gases oxygen and hydrogen together in a grain of water, “as is present
in a discharge of lightning.” When water is decomposed by the electric
current, the force which determines the oxygen and acid matter held in solution
to the positive, while the hydrogen passes to the negative pole, is not in the
poles, but in the body decomposed, he says. “The poles,” writes Faraday,
“are merely the surfaces or doors by which the electricity enters into or
passes out of the decomposing substance. They limit the extent of that
substance in the course of the electric current, being its termination in that
direction. Hence the elements evolved passed so far and no farther.”
Faraday named the poles “electrodes”—the way (in or out) of electricity.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 221.—The Galvanic Pile.</div>
</div>

<p>A very simple voltaic pile may be constructed with “gold-leaf” paper.
Take two sheets of the gold paper and paste them back to back, and two of
silver paper; cut them into discs about the size of a five-shilling-piece
(or even of half-a-crown), and place them one on
the top of the other, so as the gold and silver may be alternate;
press the discs together slightly when a good many layers have
been piled up, and introduce them into a glass tube; close the
ends of the tubes with corks through which wires are passed
from the discs top and bottom. It will be found that the ends
are charged with opposite electricities. This is the <em>Zamboni</em>
pile, or the dry pile, which was constructed of hundreds of
paper discs “tinned on one side, and covered with binoxide
of manganese on the other,” put into a tube, and closed with
brass stoppers. The electricity will last a long time in a dry pile.</p>

<p>In the accompanying illustration of the Galvanic Pile a disc of copper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
is at the bottom and a disc of zinc at the top. The latter, <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span>, is the positive
pole; the former, <span class="smcap lowercase">N</span>, the negative. When the wires are united the current is
closed, and no sign of disturbance can be detected, although the action, of
course, is proceeding within the pile. The opposite kinds of electricity
neutralize each other, and if a continuous supply were not kept up the
electricity would disappear; but as it is, a powerful current is obtained, and if
the wire be divided a spark will be observed.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 222.—Bunsen Battery.</div>
</div>

<p>There are many forms of galvanic batteries. The Trough Battery or
Cruickshank has been mentioned. There is Wollaston’s Pile, Bunsen’s
Battery, Grove’s Battery, and Daniell’s, called the “Constant” Battery. In
this last a porous earthenware cell is placed within a cylinder of copper; in
the cell a rod of zinc is inserted, the cell being filled with diluted sulphuric
acid,—one part of acid to ten parts of water,—and in the outer cylinder
is a solution of sulphate of copper.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The cut above illustrates Daniell’s Battery (fig. 223) with connectors.</p>

<p>In <em>Bunsen’s Battery</em> (or the Zinc-Carbon Battery), which is very like
the “Daniell” arrangement, as will be seen from the plates (figs. 222, 223),
the porous cell has a prism of carbon immersed in it, and is apparently
a modification of the powerful “Grove” Battery (fig. 224). This consists of
slips of platinum, <i>h</i>, placed in porous cells, <i>g</i>, each cell being surrounded by
a glass cylinder. The outer (glass) cells are filled, or nearly filled, with
diluted sulphuric acid; nitric acid is used in the porous cells, and a platinum
plate inserted. The chemical action of the Grove cell is thus explained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Professor Stewart: “The zinc dissolves in the dilute sulphuric acid, and
during this process hydrogen gas is given off. But this hydrogen does not
rise up in the shape of bubbles; it finds its way into the porous vessel which
contains the strong nitric acid. It there decomposes the acid, taking some
oxygen to itself, so as to become water (hydrogen and oxygen forming
water), and thereby turning the nitric into nitrous acid, which shows its
presence by strong orange-coloured fumes.” By this decomposition of the
nitric acid the polarization of the platinum (due to hydrogen) is avoided.
The porous cell, while keeping the liquids apart, does not interfere with the
chemical action.</p>

<p>A great number of cells are used in the Grove Battery; perhaps
even a hundred may be employed.</p>

<p><em>Smee’s Battery</em> consists of a plate of platinized silver, <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, with a bar of
wood to prevent contact with the zinc on each side, <span class="smcap lowercase">Z</span>. These are immersed
in a glass jar, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, which contains dilute sulphuric acid. The current is
obtained by metallic communication with the binding-screws on the top.
This battery has much the same general arrangement as Wollaston’s—the
position of the plates being, however, reversed; in the latter there are two
negative plates to one positive. In Smee’s Battery there are two positive
(zinc) plates to one negative plate.</p>

</div></div>

<p>It will now be understood how an electric current is produced; the
electricity passing through the cells, etc., to wires, confers certain properties
upon the wires, and we can ascertain the effect of the current by means of a
<em>Galvanometer</em>, an instrument used to detect the strength and direction of electric
currents. The current will evolve heat and light; it will excite muscular
action, and will decompose substances into their constituent elements. The
deflection of the magnetic needle by the electric current is considered the
best evidence of its power; it is on this that the Galvanometer is based.</p>

<p>We can perform a few simple experiments with the current. Suppose,
for instance, that a piece of fine wire be fixed between the pole wires of the
battery; it will be heated “white hot.” Or if two carbon points be
approached in a glass of water, as in the illustration (fig. 227), they will emit a
brilliant light in the fluid from the <em>voltaic arc</em> which has given us the electric
light. The current is the passage of electricity along the wire, and continues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
until the working power or “potential” of one conductor is equal to that of
the other. When they become equal of course the action ceases, as there is
equilibrium. But when an apparatus like the galvanic battery is brought to
bear so that the force of electricity from one conductor is made always
greater than that of the other conductor, we have a continuous flow while
the action of the battery goes on. One view of the principle is thus
expressed by Professor Gordon:<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>“If two metals be placed near together, but not in contact, in a liquid
which acts chemically more upon one than upon the other, the metals
become charged, so that the one least acted on is of higher potential than
the one most acted on. The difference of potential produced depends only
upon the nature of the metals and of the liquid, and not on the size or
position of the plates. As soon as the difference of potential has reached
its constant value the chemical action ceases.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_224.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 227.—The Voltaic arc.</div>
</div>

<p>“If now the metals are connected by a wire outside the liquid the
difference of potential begins to diminish, and an electric current flows
through the wire. As soon as the difference of potential becomes less than
the maximum for the metals and liquid, chemical action recommences and
brings it up to the maximum; and thus if no disturbing cause interferes the
current will continue until the metal most acted on is entirely dissolved.”</p>

<p>The metal most acted on is considered the “generating plate,” and is
“positive.” The other attacked less is “negative,” and is known as the
“collecting plate,” and the zinc is the positive plate. Sir W. Thomson has
shown that the electrical movement in the galvanic circuit is entirely due to
the electrical difference produced at the surfaces of contact of the dissimilar
metals. The electro-motive force obtained is not the same with all metals.
We have mentioned that some are electro-positive and some electro-negative,
and it is with reference to each other that the metals are considered to be
endowed with these properties respectively. It all depends how the metals
are arranged or coupled. With reference to their behaviour in this respect
scientists have arranged them in a series, as follows:—</p>


<ol class="table"><li>  Zinc.</li>
<li>  Cadmium.</li>
<li>  Tin.</li>
<li>  Lead.</li>
<li>  Iron.</li>
<li>  Nickel.</li>
<li>  Bismuth.</li>
<li>  Antimony.</li>
<li>  Copper.</li>
<li> Silver.</li>
<li> Gold.</li>
<li> Platinum.</li>
<li> Graphite.</li>
</ol>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>Each metal in the list is arranged so that it is electro-positive to any one
below, and electro-negative to any one above it.</p>

<p>There is another curious fact which should be mentioned. In associating
these metals it has been found that when two are brought into contact
the electro-motive force becomes greater the more distant they are in the
series given above; in other words, the force between any two is equal to
the sum of the forces between those intervening between those two. So
when zinc is used with copper its force is not so great as when used with
platinum.</p>

<p>It was Herr G. S. Ohm who laid down the law that the strength of
the electric current is equal to the electro-motive force divided by the
resistance, for he proved that the “resistance was inversely proportional to
the strength of a current.”</p>

<p>There are two other laws respecting currents; viz.,—</p>

<p>(1.) Parallel currents in the same direction attract each other.</p>

<p>(2.) Parallel currents in opposite directions repel each other.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_225.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 228. &nbsp;   Chemical action of electricity.  &nbsp;   Fig. 229.</div>
</div>


<p>Upon these two hang all the varied phenomena of electro-dynamics.
That chemical action develops electricity we can perceive with the aid of the
two cuts (figs. 228 and 229). If the wires be attached to the collecting-plate
of a condenser of electricity and the metal plate of a cell, as shown in the
figure (fig. 228), the electricity on the plate will be negative. If the operation
be reversed, and the plate be put in connection with the acid, and the metal
with the earth, the instrument will be charged with positive electricity. In
the other case, when two cups are used, united by a magnet so that the
solutions (one acid and the other alkaline) can by capillary attraction unite
upon the binding of the magnet, and we place the wires as in fig. 229,
the charge on the plate will be positive if it be in connection with the
acid, and negative if in communication with the alkaline solution. Every
time there is chemical action between two bodies in contact electricity is
produced—positive on one negative on the other, and that is the fundamental
principle of the voltaic pile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>The decomposition of water can also be effected by means of the
electric current. If two tubes or vessels be placed in a vase of water, and
the wires from the battery be inserted in them respectively, the oxygen will
go to the platinum or positive pole wire, and the hydrogen to the zinc or
negative pole. This decomposition or “splitting up” of components was
termed <span class="smcap">Electrolysis</span> by Faraday, who gave a series of names to the action
and the actors in these phenomena (fig. 230).</p>

<p>Any liquid body, such as the water we have just decomposed for
instance, Faraday termed an <em>electrolyte</em>; the surfaces where the current
enters or leaves the body were called <em>electrodes</em>—the “ways,” from <em>odos</em>, a
“way”; the entry is the <em>anode</em>; the leaving point the <em>katode</em>, from <em>ana</em>, “up,”
and <em>kata</em>, “down.” The electrolyte is divided into two portions, “ions”
(“movers”), which move towards the electrodes, which are positive and
negative. In the case of the decomposition of water the hydrogen goes to
the negative electrode, the oxygen to the positive.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_226.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 230.—Decomposition of water.</div>
</div>


<p>There are a few observations to be made respecting electrolysis. One
rule is, that it “never takes place unless the electrolyte is in a liquid state.”
The liquid state is essential. It is also observed that the components go to
the different electrodes; such elements as go to the negative electrode are
termed electro-positive, the others electro-negative; or, as Faraday termed
them, “anions” or “kations:” The chemical power or electrolytic action of
the current is the same at all parts of the circuit; the quantity of the substance
decomposed is in exact proportion to the strength of the current.
Faraday measured the strength of the electric current, and invented for
the purpose an instrument called the Voltameter. We have mentioned
the Galvanometer more than once, and will proceed to describe it. There
are several forms of this instrument: the Tangent, the Marine, and the
Reflecting Galvanometers, and the Astatic, or “Multiplier.” In the first-named
the direction of the current is determined by Ampère’s rule, which is
as follows:—</p>

<p>“Imagine an observer placed in the wire so that the current shall pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
through him from his feet to his head; let him turn his face to the
needle: its north pole is always deflected to his left side.”</p>

<p>The <em>“Tangent” Galvanometer</em> consists of a vertical circle like an
upright ring, across which is a support in the centre holding a copper wire,
through which the electric current passes. On this point (where the wire is)
a needle is very lightly supported, and when the instrument is to be used it
is placed so that the plane of the circle is parallel to the line in which the
needle points. The current passes, and the needle is deviated. By noting
which side the north end of the needle goes the <em>direction</em> of the current is
ascertained, and the length of the needle being small in comparison with the
diameter of the circle through which the current passes, the <em>strength</em> of the
current in the vertical circle is in proportion to the <em>tangent</em> of the angle
through which the needle turns. Hence the term “Tangent” Galvanometer.</p>

<p>The “Reflecting” instrument is the invention of Sir William Thomson,
in which a mirror is attached to the needle, and reflects a small focus of
light upon a scale. The movements, however minute, are easily read. Sir
W. Thomson’s Galvanometers are extremely sensitive. We need not mention
any other varieties, as full descriptions can easily be obtained. We
only need to indicate the mode of working.</p>

<p>The accompanying illustration (fig. 231) shows an Astatic Galvanometer
which may be used in two ways—either to
measure strength of current, or to find out a
current; in the latter case it would be termed
a Galvanoscope. It is a compound needle
instrument, and consists of two needles placed
in parallel directions with opposite poles
above each other in a coil. The wire coil
is wound round a bobbin, and the astatic
needle is placed therein and suspended
freely, as in the illustration, by a cocoon
thread. The upper needle moves upon a
scale, <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>, and the instrument is enclosed
in a glass shade. The screw, <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span>, communicates
with the upper needle, and fixes it at
zero point when ready for use. The wires
are fastened to the binding-screws, and the
current is then sent. The needle is deflected
accordingly, and the number of degrees on the scale can be read off.</p>

<p>The uses of the galvanic current are many. Amongst them Electroplating
is perhaps the most generally useful, though Electrotyping is also a
very important process in art. A visitor to Birmingham may view the process
carried on there by some enterprising firms, who have succeeded
wonderfully in producing electro-plate. The principle is very simple and
easy to understand, but the greatest care and watchfulness are required on
the part of the men employed. The principle, as we have said, is simple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
and consists in the fact that if a plate of metal be suspended and attached
to the positive pole of a galvanic battery and immersed in a solution of the
same metal, the conducting substance hung opposite at the negative pole
becomes coated with the metal immersed in the solution.</p>

<p>Suppose we take a plate of silver, and immerse it in cyanide of silver
dissolved in cyanide of potassium; a coating of silver will be deposited
upon the nickel spoon or other article suspended at the other pole. But to
make the coating adhere the spoons, forks, etc., are prepared for the bath
by cleansing in caustic potash to remove grease, and washed in nitric acid to
remove all traces of oxide, then are scoured with sand. Next, a thin coating
of mercury is put on by immersion in solution of nitrate of mercury.
Finally, they are hung in the bath. A metal rod is hung across the bath
(fig. 232), and the plate is immersed. If the rod to which the articles are
suspended be attached to the zinc or negative pole, and the plate of silver
to the positive pole of the battery, decomposition begins, and the silver
begins to attach itself to the suspended objects. If it be desirable to give
the plated articles a thick coating, they are retained for a long time in the
bath, which is of some non-conducting material. The dull appearance is
easily removed by brushing and burnishing, and then the “Electro-plate” is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
ready for the warehouse. The gilding process is performed in the same
manner, a gold plate being substituted for the silver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Electrotyping</span> may be briefly explained as follows:—Take two
vessels, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, and in one, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, put some dilute sulphuric acid and two plates,
one of zinc, <span class="smcap lowercase">Z</span>, the other of copper, <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>, but be sure they are not touching each
other; each of these plates must have a piece of wire fastened, by soldering
to their upper parts. In the vessel, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, put some solution of sulphate of
copper and a small quantity of dilute sulphuric acid, and attach another
copper plate to the wire which comes from the copper plate in the acid;
this second copper plate is to be immersed in the solution of sulphate of
copper, and to the wire from the zinc plate is to be fixed the object to be
coated. If a medallion or other object in plaster, it should be soaked in
very hot wax and then brushed over with blacklead until the surface is perfectly
blackened and bright; the wire should be bound all round the margin
and soldered (as it were) with melted wax to the medallion, taking care that
this wax also is well coated with blacklead. If the object be now immersed
in the sulphate of copper solution and kept at a short distance from the
plate (it must not touch it), a coating of copper will soon cover the surface
and form a perfect cast, which, when of sufficient thickness, may be removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
by filing the edge all round. If instead of the plaster cast a copper coin or
other copper object be used, the blackleading is not required, but the
surface must be first made clean and bright.</p>

<p>Many uses are made of the galvanic current by medical men. If the
circuit of the pile is closed and we take a wire in each hand and break
contact, a concussion will be felt in the joints of the arm and fingers, and a
certain contraction of the muscles. The currents of electricity cause the
shocks, and by a peculiar arrangement by which the circuit can be closed or
broken at pleasure, a series of shocks can be sent through the body when it
forms the connection between the poles of the battery. We give illustrations
of a medico-galvanic machine. In fig. 235 there are two batteries, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, with cells, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>. Each battery consists of a central plate of platinized
silver separated from the zinc plates by a piece of wood, <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span>; the
binding-screws are fastened to the silver plates, and <span class="smcap lowercase">G</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span> retain the zinc plates;
<span class="smcap lowercase">I</span> is a copper band connecting the zinc plate of one battery with the silver
plate of the other. At <span class="smcap lowercase">Z</span> and opposite are wires leading to the coil machine.
The quantity and intensity of the current are regulated respectively by the
indicator, <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>, and the wires, <span class="smcap lowercase">Q</span>. There is a point, <span class="smcap lowercase">R</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, for the breaking of the
contact; <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">N</span> are screws retaining the wires which lead to the handles, <span class="smcap lowercase">U</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span>,

Horse-shoe magnets.</div>
</div>


<p>The electric current is employed in many diseases, and is of great use
in some cases, but the further consideration of it with reference to its medical
applications does not fall within the scope of our present work. We will
now pass on to one of the most useful applications of the electric force, the
Telegraph, and in dealing with it we must make a few remarks upon magnetism.
First, let us make an experiment or two, and see the reciprocal action between
electricity and magnetism.</p>

<p>(1.) If we take a piece of iron of the form of a horse-shoe (fig. 236), and
wind around it copper wire, and pass through the wire an electric current from
our battery, the iron will exhibit strong magnetic properties, which it will lose
when the current is interrupted. The conducting wires are insulated with silk,
and the current will then travel in one direction.</p>

<p>(2.) If we cover the ends of a non-magnetic piece of iron with coils
of wire, and rotate the magnet, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, so as to cause the poles to approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
each end of the iron alternately, an electric current will be established in
the wire.</p>

<p>(3.) Referring to the first experiment, if we bring a needle in contact
with the iron horse-shoe, while the current is passing through the wire we
shall find that the needle has become a magnet; <i>i.e.</i>, that it will point due
north and south when suspended.</p>

<p>We will now see what a Magnet is, and why it has obtained this
name.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_231a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 239.—Magnetic attraction.</div>
</div>


<p>In Magnesia, in Lydia, in olden times was found a stone of peculiar
attributes, which had the property of attracting small portions of iron. The
Chinese were acquainted with it, and nowadays it is found in many places.
In our childhood we have all read of it in the story of “Sinbad the Sailor.”
Popularly it is known as the loadstone; chemists call it magnetic oxide of
iron (F<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). This stone is a <em>natural magnet</em>. In Sweden it exists in great
quantities as “magnetic iron,” for it has a great affinity for that metal.</p>

<p>If we rub a piece of steel upon the loadstone we convert the former
into a magnet—an artificial magnet as it is called, and the <em>magnetic needle</em> so
useful to us in our compasses and in the working of one form of the electric
telegraph is thus obtained. Let us see how this needle acts.</p>

<div class="figcontainer">
  <div class="figsub">

<div class="figsub">
<img src="images/i_231c.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 241.—Double touch.</p></div>
</div></div>


<p>Take a magnetic needle and dust upon it some iron filings. You will
observe that the filings will be attracted to both ends of the magnet, but the
centre will remain uncovered. The ends of a magnet are termed “poles,”
the centre the equator. So one end is north and the other south, and we
might perhaps imagine that the same characteristics would abide in the bar
when it is cut in two. But we find that as when a worm is divided, each
portion gets a new head or tail, and makes a perfect worm, so in the magnet
each divided half becomes a perfect magnet with separate poles, one of which
always points to the north.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>The poles of the magnet display the same phenomena as regards
attraction and repulsion, as do the opposite kinds of electricity. If we
suspend a magnet and bring the north pole of another to the north pole of
the suspended magnet, the latter will turn away; but if we apply the north
pole of one to the south pole of the other they will be attracted just as
opposite electricities attract each other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Magnetization</span> is the term applied to the making of artificial
magnets, which act is accomplished by bringing the needle in contact
with other magnets, or sometimes by means of the electric current. If we
carefully stroke the needle with the magnet, always in the same direction,
lifting the magnet and beginning afresh every time, we shall magnetize the
needle, but with a different polarity from the pole it was rubbed with. A
magnet rubbing its <em>north</em> pole against a needle will make the latter’s point
<em>south</em>, and <em>vice versâ</em>.</p>

<p>Now that we have seen how the “magnetic needle” is arrived at, we
can proceed to explain the electric telegraph. The term telegraph is derived
from the Greek words <em>tele</em>, “far,” and <em>graphein</em>, “to write,” and now includes all
modes of signalling. Signalling, or telegraphing, is of very ancient origin;
the Roman generals spelt words by fire. The beacons fired on the hills, the
“Fiery Cross,” and other ancient modes are well known. The semaphore
and flags have long been and are still used as modes of signalling, while the
flashing of the heliograph “telegraphs” to a distant camp.</p>

<p>The Semaphore was invented by Chappé, and was really the first
practical system of telegraphy. It was adopted in 1794, but before this, in
1753, a letter appeared in the <cite>Scots Magazine</cite>, by Charles Marshall, suggesting
that signals should be given by means of electric wires, equal in
number to the letters of the alphabet. Soon afterwards Lesage, of Geneva,
made an electric telegraph to be worked by frictional electricity, and many
ingenious attempts were subsequently made to utilize electricity for signalling
purposes, but without any permanent success; indeed, the British government
were quite content with their semaphores, for they wrote that “telegraphs
of any kind are now wholly unnecessary, and no other than the one
now in use will be adopted”!</p>

<p>The <em>Electric Telegraph</em> has had considerable antiquity claimed for it,
but it is pretty certain that the discovery made by Doctor Watson, in 1747,
that electricity would pass through wires, and that the earth would complete
the circuit, gave the first impetus to the Electric Telegraph. Doctor Watson
was enabled to transmit shocks across the Thames, and made experiments at
Shooters Hill. Franklin did likewise across the Schuykill in 1748, and
De Luc performed the same experiments on the Lake of Geneva. Both
Lesage and Lomond caused pith balls to diverge at distant points, and in
1794 Reizen made use of the electric spark for transmitting signals, and
made strips of foil show out certain letters when the spark passed. He had
a wire and a return wire for each letter of the alphabet.</p>

<p>These were all slow advances, and subsequently many learned men in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
Europe sought to improve upon the ideas then promulgated. We read of
telegraphs constructed at Madrid by Salvá and Betancourt in 1797 and 1798,
one extending for more than twenty miles. The first-named gentleman
finally proposed to substitute the Voltaic pile for the usual machine, and
Ronalds and Dyar in England and New York respectively employed frictional
electricity with some success. The latter sent charges of frictional electricity
through a wire, and they were recorded by being made to pass through
litmus paper. The distances between the discharges were intended to indicate
the letters of the alphabet, but even if the experiment was fairly tried it
failed, for little was heard of the result.</p>

<p>After the invention of Volta’s pile, which Salvá wished to adopt,
Sömmering began his experiments. He used thirty-five wires, set up
vertically at the bottom of a glass reservoir of water, and terminating in gold
points. These wires ended in the opposite direction in brass plates attached
to a bar of wood. At one end the points and at the other the plates bore the
same letters respectively; hydrogen at one gold point, and oxygen at another,
and two different letters were indicated when the current was sent through
any two plates. This arrangement was afterwards improved upon, and only
two wires retained.</p>

<p>It was not until electro-magnetism had been developed, however, that
Œrstead found out the power of electricity to deflect the magnetised needle,
and in 1820, Scheweigger added a “multiplier.” Then came Arago into the
field with his discovery, that a “wire carrying a current could magnetise a
steel rod.” Ampère substituted a helix for a straight wire, and Sturgeon used
soft iron for steel, and developed the electro-magnet. Daniell’s battery, and
Faraday’s discoveries of magneto-electricity and the induction coil were the
means of putting a constant supply of electricity at the service of the
telegraph and so on, till 1830 brought out a more practical method introduced
by Schilling.</p>

<p>In that year Baron Schilling made a telegraph, and exhibited it in 1832
at Bonn. This invention, with five vertical needles, was shown to Mr. Cooke in
1836. But in 1834, Gauss and Weber had succeeded in sending signals by
means of a voltaic current acting upon a magnetised needle, and this apparatus
was really the first practical electric telegraph in use, and it was much
improved by Professor Steinheil of Munich. They employed a magnetic-electro
machine, and caused a bar to move in certain directions to indicate
certain letters of the alphabet. This was really of value, but Steinheil, the
pupil of Gauss, assisted by his government, employed only a single wire, and
made the earth complete the circuit for him instead of having a return wire
as his predecessors had. This telegraph was perfected by a series of bells,
which gave different tones for different letters, and he also caused the needle
to make certain tracings as it moved upon a paper slip, something like the
Morse pattern, which was completed in 1837.</p>

<p>Professor Morse, in 1832, conceived the idea of an electric telegraph
but his claim was disputed by a Doctor Jackson, who was on the same vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
when the subject was discussed. We need not enter into the details of the
controversy. Mr. Morse won the day, and patented his invention.</p>

<p>“It was once a popular fallacy in England and elsewhere that Messrs.
Cooke and Wheatstone were the original inventors of the electric telegraph.
The electric telegraph had, properly speaking, no inventor.... Messrs.
Cooke and Wheatstone were, however, the first who established a telegraph
for practical purposes comparatively on a large scale, and in which the public
were more nearly concerned.... Therefore it was that the names of these
enterprising and talented inventors came to the public ear, while those of
Ampère and Steinheil remained comparatively unknown.<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> The telegraph, as
used in Great Britain, was the result of the co-operation of Professors Cooke
and Wheatstone.</p>

<p>Mr. Cooke, in 1836, having seen the needle telegraph when in
Heidelberg, made certain designs, and soon entered into partnership with
Professor Wheatstone for the application of electric telegraphs to railways.
Their apparatus with five needles and five wires was put up on the
London and North-Western (then London and Birmingham) and Great
Western lines, but proved too expensive. The instrument was
subsequently modified, and is used on the English railways still.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 242.—Cell.</div>
</div>


<p>We may now proceed to look at the Wheatstone needle
telegraph and see the method of working it. We know already
that when a pair of metallic plates are immersed in a fluid
which acts chemically more rapidly on the one than the other,
and a wire connects the upper parts of these plates, this wonderful
agency is set in motion, and circulates from the one
plate to the other (fig. 242). This arrangement may be best
shown by using one plate of zinc and the other of copper, and a dilute solution
of sulphuric acid for the liquid; this, however, produces by far too little of the
agent to be used on a telegraphic line, there are therefore combinations of such
pairs of plates, so arranged that the power of one pair shall be added to the
next in such a way that at the end of the series (called a “battery”) there
shall be a great increase of the power accumulated; this arrangement is
shown in fig. 244. Now (if the power be sufficient) it does not signify what
length of wire there may be between the two ends of this arrangement or
“battery”; whether they be connected by a few feet or many hundred miles,
the electricity passes instantaneously from one end to the other; and
furthermore, it has been found in practice, that this electrical influence can
be transmitted through the earth in one direction if sent by a wire in the
other; for instance, if a wire from one end of the battery be carried on from
London to Liverpool, instead of having another from Liverpool to London,
to connect the two ends of the battery, it is found to answer the same
purpose if the end of the wire at Liverpool be fastened to a plate of metal
buried beneath the surface of the earth, and the other end of the battery at
London furnished with a similar plate, also buried. In this arrangement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
the electricity will pass beneath the surface of the earth from Liverpool to
London, and through the wire from London to Liverpool, thus completing
the circuit. The end from which the electricity passes is called the
“positive electrode,” that to which it returns, the “negative electrode.”
Fig. 245 will show this arrangement.</p>

Magnetic needles.</div>
</div>

<p>If a bar-magnet be suspended on a pivot so that it may turn freely, it
will (as is well known) turn with one end to the north, which is owing to a
current of natural electricity passing round the earth in the direction of east
and west, the magnet crossing the current at a right angle; and if a coil of
wire coated with silk (to keep one part of the coil from another) be placed
round, above, and below the long axis of a bar of steel, as shown at fig. 246,
and a current of electricity passed through the wire, the steel becomes a
magnet, and will take a direction similar to the natural magnet, more or less,
at right angles to this coil, as in fig. 247, according to the intensity of the
current; and the instant this electrical current is stopped, it will resume its
former direction. This fact has been made use of to form the principal
feature of all English telegraphs; such a needle is mounted in an upright
position, and instead of its tendency to turn to the north, a tendency to
maintain the upright position is given to it by having one of the arms of
the magnet a little heavier than the other; such a magnet having a coil of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
wire surrounding it. When the electric current passes through the coil, it
will turn out of the upright position to either one side or the other, according
to the direction of the current, from its tendency to assume a position
at an angle thereto (fig. 248); if the current be stopped even for an instant,
then the needle, or magnet, will again assume its upright position. The
pivot of this magnet is brought forward, and has on its front part another
needle, which turns with it; this is visible on the outside of the apparatus,
and is looked at to ascertain the movement of the one within. There is
also an arrangement called a “commutator,” so contrived, that by moving a
handle to the right or left, a connection shall be made with either end of
the battery, and thereby cause the direction of the current and needle to be
changed at pleasure; also by moving the handle into an upright position
the current shall be stopped; and finally, by a third movement, a bell shall
be rung. Now, as has already been explained, when the current goes in one
direction, the magnetic needle is deflected in that direction; and when the
current is reversed the position of the needle is also reversed, and when the
current is cut off the needle will resume its perpendicular position. If two
such needles and two such handles be at each station, when the handles at
one station are moved, the needles at the other station will take on a similar
movement; and when the handles at that station are moved, the needles at
the first station will be moved to correspond. This constitutes the system
of communication kept up by the electric telegraphs in England; but it
remains to be shown how all the letters of the alphabet and numerals can
be represented by the movements of the two handles. These handles can
be placed in eight positions (besides the upright one) by a single movement
of each hand, as may be seen in fig. 249; and these eight signals if repeated,
or made twice in rapid succession will make eight more, and by being
repeated three times will constitute a third eight, making twenty-four;
finally, by a rapid motion right and left, they may be caused to signify a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
fourth eight, or thirty-two signals, which are found to be sufficient for every
purpose, and by practice may be both produced and read off with facility.
Before a message is about to be delivered the commutator is so placed as
to ring a bell, which is done by the same arrangement as in a common
alarm-clock, but the action is set in motion by a peculiar contrivance, which
depends upon the property a bar of soft iron has of becoming magnetic
when a wire is wound round it and a current of electricity passed through
this wire; this magnetic property exists only as long as the current passes,
and stops the instant it is cut off. The catch of the alarm is disengaged by
the movement of a bar of iron being drawn to the magnet while the current
passes, and forced back again by a spring when it is stopped, thus setting in
action the mechanism of the alarm; or in some cases there is a simple
contrivance for causing a rapid flow and stoppage of the electricity, so that
the bar is alternately attracted by the magnet and released by the spring,
and this motion rings the bell as long as it is continued. The bell is always
rung to give notice that a message is about to be sent, and at the station
where it rings, the bell at the former station is rung in return, to show that
they are prepared to receive the message: which is then spelt, letter after
letter, by moving the handles into the proper positions, and as it is being
sent, the eye is kept on the dials, certain single signs are made and recognised,
which will communicate any reply from the station to which the message is
being sent, such as “repeat,” or “not understood.” The wires which
convey the electricity are made of galvanised iron (iron coated with zinc),
and as they must be kept from all communication with the earth by some
substance incapable of conducting it, they are therefore stretched between
wooden poles (fig. 250), and rest upon sockets or supports of glass or glazed
earthenware, which are both substances incapable of conducting the electricity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
to the earth (fig. 251), and in order that these may be quite dry, an inverted
cup of metal, glass, or earthenware is placed over it, or the whole is blown
or moulded in one piece. If the support for the wires were not kept from
the rain, the wet would form a conducting surface, and allow the electricity
to escape into the earth.</p>

<p>In the single needle instrument the letters are indicated by right and
left vibrations, from A one right, to B one right and left, and so on, increasing
to Z. This mode is now generally used.</p>

<p>The manner in which the current passes is shown by the following
illustrations (figs. 252, 253).</p>

<p>For the sake of clearness, the diagram has been drawn with simple
lines only. In the real needle-machine the construction is much more
complicated; perspective drawings of it may be seen in Lardner’s “Electric
Telegraph,” and numerous other works. In fig. 1, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> is a single cell of a
battery containing a plate of copper, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, and a plate of zinc, <span class="smcap lowercase">Z</span>, immersed in
sulphuric acid and water. H is the handle of the instrument, turning from
left to right, and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>, like the handle of a door, consisting of two
pieces of brass insulated from each other by being inserted in an axis of
ivory. To the ends of the two pieces of brass are fixed the wires, <span class="smcap lowercase">CW</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">ZW</span>, leading from the copper and zinc ends of the cell respectively. Fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
on each side of the handle are two plates of metal, which may be called <span class="smcap lowercase">LP</span>,
the left plate, and <span class="smcap lowercase">RP</span>, the right plate. They are connected with the needle
wire, <span class="smcap lowercase">NW</span>, which passes before and behind the magnetized needle, <span class="smcap lowercase">N</span>, suspended
perpendicularly on its axis, with its north pole upwards. As long as the
wires, <span class="smcap lowercase">CW</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">ZW</span>, remain insulated from each other, no current passes from
the cell; but as soon as the handle, <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>, is turned, so that the copper end
touches the left plate (fig. 2), and the zinc end touches the right, communication
is established between the plates of the cell, and the current commencing
at the copper passes along <span class="smcap lowercase">CW</span>, the top half of <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>, into <span class="smcap lowercase">LP</span>, along
<span class="smcap lowercase">N</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">W</span>, travelling <em>up before</em> and <em>down behind</em> the needle, causing it to deflect to
the observer’s left, according to the rule given above. Reaching <span class="smcap lowercase">RP</span>, it
passes downwards to the cell to <span class="smcap lowercase">Z</span>, and so on to <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, continuing its travels
and keeping the needle deflected as long as the handle remains in contact
with the plates. If it is required to deflect the needle to the right, the
handle is turned to the right, bringing its copper end in contact with the
right plate, causing the current to travel in the opposite direction. By
following the current from the copper to the zinc, as indicated by the arrows
in fig. 3, it will be seen that it now travels <em>up behind</em> and <em>down before</em> the
needle, deflecting it to the observer’s right. Thus, by causing a current
of voltaic electricity to pass alternately <em>up before</em> and <em>down behind</em>, and <em>up
behind</em> and <em>down before</em>, the needle is moved to the left or the right at will.
The way in which the current is made to act on a distant needle is now simple.
The following figure (fig. 253) shows the arrangement. The left portion
of the figure represents an instrument at London, that on the right an instrument
at York. The needle-wire, instead of being continued directly to the
zinc plate of the battery, passes away from the needle over poles to York,
where it joins an instrument similar in all respects to that at London. It
passes similarly before and behind a magnetized needle, joining the right
plate of the instrument. As long as the two plates are unconnected, no
current can pass. The current is therefore completed by a contrivance
which may be represented by the semicircular piece of metal, <span class="smcap lowercase">K</span>. In practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
the two plates or springs, which, when not in use, are always pressed against
the connector, <span class="smcap lowercase">K</span>, which is a cross-piece on the top of the handle, keeping the
London needle in circuit with the York battery, and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>. As soon
as London uses his handle, it presses the spring-plate, and puts his needle
out of the York circuit, the current he sets up sending York needle to the
right or left, as the case maybe. The second wire connecting the left York
plate with the right London plate is, it will be seen, not carried along like
the first wire. Use is made in this case of the conducting power of the
earth itself, plates from the wires being buried many feet below the surface
at London and York. When London wishes to speak to York, he first
signifies his intention of so doing by ringing York’s alarum. This he effects
by sending a current through an electro-magnet placed above York’s
instrument. The armature is attracted, and frees the detent of the alarum,
setting it ringing until York signals ready. London then stops the bell,
and commences his message. By following the direction of the current,
when the handle is turned to the left, as in fig. 4[within fig. 253], it will be readily seen how
this is effected: commencing with London’s copper, <span class="smcap lowercase">LC</span>, it passes up before
and down behind London’s needle, flowing along the wire between the two
cities to York’s needle, up before and down behind which it travels, sending
it also to the left. It then passes to York’s right plate, through the
connector to the left plate, and so on to earth at York, coming to the
surface again at London, passing through London’s right plate and through
the lower part of the handle to the zinc of the battery. The reverse
current may be easily followed. Any number of instruments with similar
needles may be interposed along the course of the wire. When the operator
wishes to speak to any particular one, he rings all the bells for attention,
and then signals Derby or Nottingham, as the case may be. They all then
throw their instruments out of current except the one required. The mode
by which the needle movements are converted into language is simple.
A is signalled by causing the needle to vibrate once to the right, B once
right and once left, C once right and twice left; and so on, as arranged.</p>

<p>The Morse system of telegraphy was first brought out in 1844, and
was worked by means of a Voltaic battery, an electro-magnet being used at
the receiving station. This magnet attracted an “armature,” and by it dots
or lines are marked on a moving paper band by a point at the other end of
the wire, on the register in which the paper is carried by rollers which move
out by clockwork. The lever being “tapped” down in fast or slow pressures
will give a corresponding series of dots or lines (according as the pressure is
long or short) upon the moving strip of paper at the receiving station. Three
taps will give C, one tap and a pause will make A. The dots are “taps” on
the key, the lines brief “rests” on it, as will be seen from the alphabet
below, which is given as a specimen.</p>

<p>The various stops are also indicated in the same manner by combinations of
dots and lines.</p>

<p>The Atlantic telegraph cables and similar enclosed wires between other
countries are too well known to need detailed description. There is a great
variety of telegraphic instruments. The dial, and other arrangements, are
very common, and the Wheatstone Key instrument is supplied to private
firms as being the most handy. It requires but a very short apprenticeship,
and any person who is handy can easily learn to work it in a few minutes.
The apparatus consists of a dial upon which the letters of the alphabet are
printed, each letter being supplied with a key or stop. A pointer is placed
in the centre, as in the wheel barometer, and there is a handle beneath. In
front, upon a sloping board, is another dial plate and pointer; thus we
have the receiver and transmitter before us in a very small space.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_242.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 254.—Receiver. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dial Telegraph. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fig. 255.—Manipulator.</div>
</div>

<p>When it is necessary to work the instrument a bell is rung by turning
the handle rapidly. To speak by the instrument it is necessary to keep
turning the handle with the right hand while the fingers of the left are
employed in pressing down in as rapid succession as practice will permit the
keys corresponding to the letters on the dial while the handle is kept turning.
When a word is completed the operator must stop at the + at the top, and
then begin again, stopping after each word. When all is said, a couple of
rapid turns of the dial will signify that you have ended.</p>

<p>There are many other systems of telegraph, but all are dependent upon
the same principles. The accompanying illustrations (figs. 254, 255) show a
dial telegraph of a simple kind, which almost explains itself.</p>

<p>The first figure is the receiver, on which is a pointer fixed to a dial-plate
having the letters of the alphabet inscribed around it. When the
manipulator is being worked the dart points to the letters in succession of
the words used, and they are separately spelt. The manipulator (fig. 255),
by closing and opening the circuit, works the needle.</p>

<p>In the manipulator we have a wheel with an index point fixed above
it. In this wheel are thirteen teeth, with the openings between them filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
with ivory. The axis of the wheel is in contact with the wire from the
positive pole, <i>p</i>, and a spring attached to the wire or by the binding-screw, <i>t</i>,
presses against the circumference of the wheel, and completes the circuit.
When the wheel is placed so that the arrow point is above the +, the needle
of the receiver is also at +. By turning the wheel to bring the needle to <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>,
the spring on the circumference is passed from an ivory “tooth” to a “metal”
one; the circuit is closed, the point of the receiver also turns to <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, and so on
through the word by successive closing and breaking of the circuit.</p>

<p>As there are a great many other applications of electricity of which we
have to treat,—the Electric Light, and Mr. Edison’s other inventions,—our
space will not permit a much more detailed account of the telegraph, but there
are some incidents connected with its progress which it would be as well to
mention.</p>

<p>Alexander Bain, about 1840, attempted to produce a printing
telegraph, and in 1846 he actually accomplished a registering apparatus,
which was an application of the principles of Dyar and Davy. But although
Bain’s system was good, Morse had the advantage of possession in the
United States, where it was tried, and Bain went out of fashion. Bain’s
system was, in fact, the present chemical “automatic” telegraph, which has
been perfected for rapid transmission.</p>

<p>Bakewell’s instrument, which has been improved upon by later electricians,
is termed the fac-simile telegraph. The message to be sent is written
with a pen which has been dipped in varnish (for ink), and the characters are
inscribed upon prepared tinfoil. The message is then put upon a cylinder
covered with prepared paper, and has a pointer attached. There is a
precisely similar cylinder at the receiving station. When the cylinders are
simultaneously set going, the point at one will trace a spiral line as the
first (transmitting) point passes round its cylinder. However, as the latter
“stylus” meets the varnish letters a break occurs, and these spaces are
exactly reproduced as blanks at the other end, and the form of the letters
can be seen. Coselli, in his adaptation, caused dark letters to be registered
on a white ground, and thus simplified matters. Since then we have had
printing telegraphs, and dials, and writing machines, one of which will be
described presently.</p>

<p>Submarine telegraphs were, it is said, first suggested by Salvá in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
1797, and Wheatstone, in 1840, declared that it was quite possible to
connect England and France by wire. Morse and Calt experimented with
submarine cables in America, and Lieutenant Siemens first applied gutta-percha
to the wires as an insulator in the Prussian line of telegraph across
the Rhine. The English laid a wire between Dover and Calais, which was
broken, but successfully relaid. And so on, till in 1857 the great project of
the Atlantic cable was broached. We give illustrations of the cables; the
circumstances connected with the laying of which, and the enthusiasm over the
successful accomplishment of the task, must be in the memory of all. The
readings of the messages were shown by delicate galvanometers, the beam
of light being reflected from a mirror. This cable was lost, and in 1862
Mr. Field came over to urge the importance of the submarine cable between
this country and America. The cable was shipped on the <em>Great Eastern</em>
in 1865, and was 2,186 miles long. It consisted of seven copper wires
twisted, and covered with gutta-percha. The outside coating consists of ten
iron wires surrounded by manilla yarn. But this cable broke, and a third
was made and laid in 1866. The old cable was then recovered and spliced.
There are some two hundred cables now in existence, the last being the Cape
cable, laid when the Boer War was engaging our attention. The transmitting
apparatus of Mr. Varley and Sir W. Thomson has greatly accelerated the
rapidity of messages, and Thomson’s syphon recorder farther increased the
speed.</p>

<p>The following description of a new system is from <cite>Scribner’s Magazine</cite>
for 1880:—</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">New Telegraphic System.</span></p>

<p>“A new system of sending and receiving electrical impulses over an
insulated wire has recently been brought into successful operation, that
seems to promise not only a radical change in the present methods of telegraphing,
but a material gain in the speed and cost of sending messages by
wire. It is founded on a union of the so-called “automatic” and “chemical”
systems of telegraphy. The first of these employs a strip of paper having,
by some mechanical means, a series of small holes punched in it, the design
being to pass the perforated strip under a needle, or stylus, in electrical
connection with the line. This stylus, on passing over the paper, opens the
circuit, but in passing one of the holes, drops through and closes it,—this
alternate making and breaking of the circuit transmitting the message. The
chemical telegraph records any electrical impulses sent over a line by staining
a strip of prepared paper passing under it.  This is founded on the fact
that electricity has the power of decomposing certain chemicals, and if paper
is soaked in these chemicals and submitted to the action of electricity, it will
be discoloured wherever the current passes. While both of these systems
have been used, neither has been able to compete with the more simple
Morse key and sounder, and it has remained for the new system to bring
them to a position where they may come into general use. The new system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
is a modification and combination of the automatic and chemical systems, the
transmitting being performed by means of a perforated strip of paper, and
the receiving of the message being recorded by the discolouration of chemically
prepared paper. The process is entirely mechanical and chemical, the
telegraph operator having no direct control over the message, either by
sight, sound, or touch. The written message is sent to the operating-room,
and given to the person using the perforating machine. This consists of a
small key-board, with black and white keys, each marked with a letter or
sign, and an ingenious system of levers, operated by the keys, for punching
small holes in a ribbon of paper moving past the side of the machine. The
machine stands upon a small table, and under it is a treadle for giving
motion to the feeding apparatus for supplying the paper to the machine.
The operator moves the treadle with his feet, and at the same time touches
each key to spell out the message. In a very few seconds the message is
imprinted on the ribbon in the form of a double row of small perforations,
each group of two holes representing a dash, and each single hole a dot,
as in the Morse alphabet. Each letter is separated from the next by a
longer dash, and each word by a still longer dash, and each sentence
by a dash of indefinite length. This spacing of the letters is performed
automatically, the spacing of words and sentences is performed by the
operator. The perforated slip containing the message is then sent to
the transmitting machine. This consists essentially of a metallic wheel,
divided into two sections by means of a thin insulation of hard rubber.
One section of the wheel is connected with the positive pole of the
battery, and the other section with the negative pole. A pair of fine
metallic brushes, both of which are connected directly with the line, are
suspended above the wheel, and are arranged so as to press lightly upon the
latter, when desired. When resting on the wheel the circuit is closed, and
when raised above it the circuit is broken. The perforated strip is, by a
simple piece of mechanism, made to pass over the face of this wheel and
under the brushes. While the paper is passing, both brushes are raised from
the wheel, and slide over the paper, and the circuit is broken. On passing a
hole, one of the brushes drops through and closes the circuit for an instant.
On passing two or more holes, arranged in a series close together, the brush
closes the circuit for a shorter or longer time, according to the number of
holes, and as the perforations on the paper are arranged in two rows,
alternating from one to the other, the brushes are used alternately, and the
polarity of the current is continually changed with every impulse sent over
the line. No special skill is required in sending a message, as the operator
has only to put the perforated strip in the machine and turn a hand-crank,
to cause it to pass rapidly under the brushes, and with a little practice, a
young girl can send messages at the rate of one thousand words a minute,
with absolute precision. The receiving apparatus consists essentially of a
simple piece of mechanism for causing a strip of chemically prepared paper
to pass rapidly under two small needles that are connected with the line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
As the paper passes the needles, the electricity sent over the line from the
transmitting machine seeks the earth through the wet paper and the machine,
and in passing discolours the paper, each stain representing a dot or dash, and
the message is printed on the paper in a double row of marks at the same
speed with which it was dispatched. In practice, a Morse key and sounder
is placed at each end of the line, and on sending a message the transmitting
operator calls the receiving station, and when the operator at the distant end
replies, both turn the cranks in their machine swiftly, and the message is sent
and received at an average speed of one thousand words a minute. The
message received is given to a person using a type-writer, and at once
translated into print and sent out by the messenger boy. It is found in
practice that two operators, one at each end of a single wire of indefinite
length, can keep fifteen operators fully employed in preparing the messages,
and fifteen girls busy in translating and printing the messages for delivery.
The system is of American origin.”</p>

<p>Of the hundred and one uses to which electric wires are now appropriated—of
the alarms, fire-calls, clocks, etc.—we need not speak. We must
pass on to the Writing Machine (fig. 258) before we make mention of
Mr. Edison’s inventions.</p>

<p>The Writing Machine is as remarkable for the simplicity of its mechanism
as for the facility and ease with which it can be used. It was invented by
Remington, the American, whose name is so universally known in connection
with a repeating rifle. He makes these writing machines in his own factory,
where he associates them with rifles and sewing machines—implements for
war and peace.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Writing Machine may be easily perceived from
the illustration (fig. 258), which is drawn to scale one-fourth of the actual
size. It comprises a key-board, upon which there are forty-four keys or stops,
including numbers from 2 to 9, the <i>i</i> and <i>o</i> of the alphabet serving for
numbers 1 and 0, and all the letters of the alphabet arranged in the manner
most convenient for manipulation. There are also the various accents and
stops, with note of interrogation, etc. The flat ruler at the base of the key-board
is struck when it is necessary to separate one word from another.</p>

<p>In the interior of the apparatus every letter is attached to a small
hammer, and corresponds to the pressure bestowed upon the notes, which are
disposed in a circle. If A, for example, be touched upon the key-board, the
hammer will bring A to the centre of the circle, and so every letter of the
word will be, by such action, brought to the centre of the circle in succession.
The paper upon which the letter is printed is wound upon a cylinder
mounted upon a slide, as seen in the upper portion of the illustration.</p>

<p>When the letter is pressed down on the key-board the corresponding
hammer strikes against the cylinder, between which and the hammer is a
ribbon prepared with a special ink. The letter being in relief like ordinary
type is impressed upon the paper. The slide upon which the paper is
mounted is so arranged as to move from right to left exactly a letter-breadth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
after each impression. Thus as every hammer strikes at the same spot a
regular succession of letters are printed off, the paper moving with regularity.
When the line is filled—that is, when the paper has moved across the
cylinder—a bell rings, and a handle is moved by the operator who is thus
warned. The lever moved brings the slide back again, and a new plain
surface is ready to commence upon the cylinder moving upwards at the same
time, and displaying the printed line.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_247.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 258.—Remington’s Writing Machine.</div>
</div>

<p>In operating both hands may be employed, but between each word
care should be taken to press down the flat board at the base of the key-board,
which has the effect of leaving a space upon the paper. Immediately
the sound of the warning bell is heard the lever at the right-hand side must
be lowered. The word can be finished in the line following if it be not
concluded, the hyphen button being pressed to indicate the continuation.</p>

<p>The paper used must not exceed the width of the cylinder, but it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
be of any less width, and a post-card or any small sheet of paper may be
substituted. If the width be thus limited the length may be indefinite, and
a very long line of paper may be used if desirable. The cylinder being made
of gutta-percha offers a soft surface to the impression of the hammer, and
causes the letter to assume greater distinctness.</p>

<p>The inked ribbon which passes underneath the paper is so arranged
that no two successive letters strike it on the same place. It moves from an
ink reservoir on the right to another on the opposite side, and it can be made
to return beneath the paper, thus keeping up the supply. The impression
being made in copying ink, the message or letter when finished can easily be
reproduced in an ordinary press. The characters are all “capitals.”</p>

<p>At first it may be found a slow means of writing, and the manipulator
may imagine he can do better without it. But if the author be certain of
what he intends to say, after a little practice at the instrument, and when he
becomes accustomed to the positions of the various letters, etc., the rate at
which words can be printed off will far exceed that at which even rapid
writers can work. A young English lady after some days’ practice was able
to write as many as ninety words a minute with this machine—a rate more
than double the average writing rate of penmanship. When such a rate or
an approximation to it can be attained, those who are quick in their ideas
will find the machine a great saving of time, and for any one afflicted with
“writer’s cramp” the gain must be enormous. We need not insist upon the
advantages the adaptation of the apparatus would confer upon editors and
readers of MSS. too often badly written, and to compositors the invention
is a great boon.</p>

<p>Finally, the working of the machine could be entrusted to the blind, and
by teaching them the form of letters which could be raised upon the key-board,
those so sadly afflicted could write with facility. Some methods for
teaching the blind to manipulate and to read from the impressions of the
hammers on the paper have already been tried with success.</p>

<p>The Electric Pen, an invention of the fertile brain of Mr. Edison, is
shown in fig. 259. The “writing” consists of a series of little holes close
together, made by a fine steel point like a put-crayon. This point is thrust
in and out with great rapidity, and passes quickly over the paper. If the
characters cannot be formed so quickly as with an ordinary pen, the writing
is very distinct.</p>

<p>The alternative movement is given to the pen by an electric motor at
once simple and ingenious, which is placed on the top of the penholder.
The general appearance of the apparatus will be understood from the cut
on next page.</p>

<p>The point is the termination of a wire which traverses the penholder,
and the upper extremity of which catches on the motor by an eccentric. This
eccentric has three teeth or cogs, and it makes sixty revolutions a second,
thus producing one hundred and eighty beats in that time. The axle
carries a plate of soft iron, which acts like the armature of an electro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>-magnet,
before which it turns with great rapidity, the current being interrupted
twice in every revolution by the commutator. The current which
moves this little apparatus is furnished by a pile of two elements in bichromate
of potash, according to Mr. Edison’s arrangement, which is considered
very successful. Carbon and zinc are employed, and when ready for action
the battery assumes the appearance of the cells in the illustration. When
the operator wishes to discontinue writing, he simply raises the stem which
has the electrodes attached to it, and the elements are thus preserved for a
future time.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the battery could be made to last several
days without any renewal of the liquid, and the plates will last for weeks.
Thus a very simple arrangement is at our disposal. Let us see what use
can be made of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_249.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 259.—Edison’s Electric Pen.</div>
</div>

<p>When we use the electric pen we obtain a great number of small holes
close to each other. Such hand-writing is not easy to decipher by mere
inspection like ordinary writing. By holding it up to the light it is more
easy to read, but in both instances reading is not easy, nor does it come by
nature as Dogberry declares. But if we consider the paper as a “negative,”
we may obtain a number of positive proofs or copies of the writing. To
obtain these successfully we must use a press, as shown in the accompanying
illustration (fig. 260).</p>

<p>The writing, or negative, is placed upon the cover to the left, where it is
firmly fastened. Upon the body of the press a sheet of white paper is placed,
and when the lid is shut down the negative comes in contact with the paper.
By means of a roller, represented in the box, the writing is blackened,—the
ink penetrates into all the holes which are upon the paper,—and after the
manner of a stencil plate the impression will be found upon the paper when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the cover is removed. The writing will have a curious effect, but practice
will speedily remove all deficiencies. The same negative will serve for a
great many impressions, quite a thousand having been taken from one. By
people accustomed to such work as many as six proofs a minute may be
obtained. Of course a little practice will be necessary in this, as in every
other case, before a correct or rapid result can be obtained, but there is no
difficulty in the practice.</p>

<p>There are two or three other applications of electricity which we must
refer to; such as the electric stamp, of which we give an illustration, and a
curious method of stopping a horse by electricity. The electric stamp
might be very advantageously employed in our post offices to obliterate the
“Queen’s Head.” The description, with illustration of this apparatus, is
annexed. (<i>See</i> fig. 261.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_250.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> Fig. 260.—Duplicating press.</div>
</div>

<p>At the lower end of the apparatus is a thin platinum wire, so arranged
as to form either a design or an initial; by this the postage stamp can be
defaced. The stamp being put in communication with the pile, the circuit
is closed by the pressure of the finger, as shown in the illustration. The
platinum grows heated and carbonises the paper, and thus proves itself an
ineffaceable stamp.</p>

<p>This apparatus may easily be used, not only by the post office
authorities, but by every one who is obliged to deface a certain number of
stamps every day, and wishes to do so rapidly and without possibility of
error.</p>

<p>An ingenious, if scarcely necessary arrangement for conquering restive
horses, and frightening them into submission, is shown in the illustration
(fig. 262). Many means have been tried to stop or conquer a restive horse,
but the most efficacious has been designed by M. Defoy; and the director of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the Paris General Omnibus Company has experimented successfully, as we
are informed, with the arrangement we are about to describe. A small
magneto-electric machine is contained in a box beside the driver, within easy
and convenient reach of his hand. The reins contain a wire, one end of
which terminates in the horse’s bit, and the other in the electro-magnetic
apparatus. When the electro-magnet is put in action an electric current is
generated, which gives the horse a shock in the mouth, and so astonishes him
that he suddenly stops in his course. If the operator have the humanity
and good sense to unite kindness to the abrupt application of the electricity,—which
in our opinion should be only used as a last resource,—no doubt
some excellent results may be obtained even with vicious animals.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_251.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 261.—The electric stamp.</div>
</div>

<p>M. Bella, the Director of the Omnibus Company, has reported that
the apparatus was tried in his presence and found very successful, and quite
easy of application; and that even the most unruly animals have been
subjected by it. On one occasion a most restive animal was thus treated on
the way to the forge. He had a tremendous objection to be shod, and
made no secret of his dislike. But a gentle application of the electric
current put quite an opposite complexion upon the matter, and after a few
minutes the animal permitted himself to be patted and caressed, and even
allowed the smith to feel his legs and inspect his feet without making any
objection whatever. His shoes were taken off, and the horse was re-shod
without any of the dangerous demonstrations hitherto indulged in by the
animal.</p>

<p>We may quote another instance of the efficacy of this method, which
is reported from Paris by M. Camille.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_252.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 262.—Electric apparatus for checking vicious horses.</div>
</div>

<p>“Many experiments have been made upon horses which had been
most difficult to shoe, and in each case we have succeeded when the electric
apparatus has been put in requisition. One horse, in particular, nothing
could subdue. He kicked and bit and jumped about in such a manner as
to render all approach impossible. We had recourse at length to M. Defoy’s
apparatus, and after the first application, and without any great difficulty,
we were able to raise the animal’s feet; but after a second lesson we were
permitted to shoe him without his offering the slightest resistance. He was
completely subdued.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>M. Defoy recently made the experiment with a very dangerous animal,
which he stopped instantaneously in full gallop (<i>see</i> fig. 262). It may be
remarked that the application of the current is not sufficiently strong to
stop the horse too suddenly. It merely causes a very unpleasant sensation—he
is not stupefied nor galvanized by the electricity. The narrator has
felt the shock applied without inconvenience, and the conclusion arrived at
is, that this method of employing electricity is far superior to the violent
and inhuman treatment so often employed to break horses, which renders
them subsequently sulky and vindictive.</p>

<p>M. Defoy has completed an electric bit and an <em>electric stick</em> quite as
ingenious as the electric rein. The <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> is simple and effective,
the wires being insulated by leather, and terminating at the extremities of
the stick. The current is induced, as before, by a small magneto-electric
machine.</p>

<small>MAGNETISM.</small></h2>

<p class="hang">THE LOADSTONE—MAGNETIC CURVES—THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE—THE
MARINER’S COMPASS—MAGNETO-ELECTRICITY.</p>


<p>We have already mentioned some of the properties of the loadstone or
magnet; but as we are now about to enter more fully into the considerations
of its attributes and of the compass, etc., we will add some further
interesting particulars.</p>

<p>Ancient writers (Pliny, Homer, and Aristotle) mentioned the
existence of the magnet, and Humboldt refers to the knowledge of it
possessed by the ancients. Pliny says “the magnet-stone is found in
Cantabria,” and we have heard of the loadstones that are supposed to
support Mahomet’s coffin at Medina. The origin of this fable was (probably)
owing to the order given by Ptolemy to his architect, Dinochares.
Ptolemy wished the roof of a temple at Alexandria to be roofed with the
magnet-stone, so that the own image of his sister, Arsinoe, should remain
suspended therein. But the death of the king and his architect prevented
the project from being carried out.</p>

<p>The name “magnet” is said to have been derived from a shepherd named
<span class="smcap">Magnes</span>, who, when tending his flock on Mount Ida, found that his iron
crook was attracted to a certain stone; and six hundred years before the
Christian era Thales wrote respecting amber and the magnet; and because
they attracted various substances, he supposed they possessed life and power.
They were the germs of the science now so developed in their applications,
and whose full powers we are scarcely yet acquainted with.</p>

<p>We may remark that other bodies besides iron and steel are capable
of magnetization; nickel and cobalt have the like property. Magnetism,
properly so called, treats of certain bodies known as <span class="smcap">Magnets</span>, describes
the properties they possess, and the influence of magnetic force upon other
substances. Electricity and magnetism are always associated, but practically
the force is the same, electricity being the current or motive power, so to
speak; and it is to Faraday that the world is indebted for the discovery of
magneto-electricity.</p>

<p>Epinus’ theory of magnetism was that all bodies possessed a substance
he termed magnetic fluid, the particles of which repelled each other. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
while supposed to repel each other, they attracted particles in other bodies.
Thus they attracted iron. Coulomb asserted that there were two fluids—a
north and south fluid. Ampère’s theory was that magnetic bodies are
made up of molecules, round which currents are always circulating in all
directions when non-magnetized, but when magnetized the currents all flow
in the same direction. The space through which a magnet diffuses its influence
was called by Faraday the <em>Magnetic Field</em>. The lines of <em>magnetic
force</em> will be understood from the accompanying illustration (fig. 263). If
we cover a magnet with a paper and scatter iron filings over it, we shall see
the manner in which the filings arrange themselves. They radiate in curves
from the poles of the magnet, and are dependent upon its form. If it
be a straight bar magnet, evenly magnetized, they will turn inward in oval
curves.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_255a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 263.—Lines of magnetic force.</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_255b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 264.—Magnetization.</div>
</div>

<p>The manner of magnetization has already been mentioned, but here we
will give further illustrations of the method of <em>magnetization</em>. Four magnets
are used, two being placed with their opposite poles apart, and upon them
is placed the bar of which a magnet is to be made. Two other magnets
separated by a piece of wood are then brought near, and subsequently
drawn from the centre to the ends of the bar. This is the <em>separated touch</em>
system; the <em>double touch</em> of Mitchell is completed by moving the upper
two magnets from end to end backwards and forwards, and finally lifting
them away from the centre.</p>

<p>A magnet, then, is a bar of steel endowed with certain properties, such as
attracting iron, etc.; and electro-magnetism is the term applied to the production
of magnetism by means of electricity, the medium being the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
electro-magnet. To understand the science it will be necessary to mention
Ampère’s theory of magnetism.</p>

<p>It was Œrsted who observed that when a magnet is placed within
reach of an electric current and free to move, it sets itself at right angles
to the direction of the current; and Ampère defined the law already
referred to when treating of the electric current,—viz., “that if a person be
imagined as placed in the wire so that the current shall pass through him
from feet to head, if he turn his face toward the magnetic needle the north
pole will always be deflected to his left-hand side.” When the current is
passed above the needle from south to north poles, the deflection is to the
west; when from north to south the deflection is east. When the current
is below the needle the contrary is the case. Ampère decided that currents
circulating in the same direction attracted each other, and when running in
opposite ways they repelled each other. He supposed currents to circulate
within all magnetic substances, and then—that is, when the body is
magnetized—these currents flow in planes parallel to each other, and the
material which offers the least resistance to the circulation of these currents
becomes the most magnetic.</p>

<p>The earth being supposed to be an immense magnet has currents
circulating through it in a direction from east to west; and having the
property or power of turning a magnetized bar in a direction similar to that
in which the bar would be turned by a magnet, the earth is considered a
magnetic mass. This influence is due to what is called “terrestrial magnetism.”
If we suspend a bar by a thread it will point in no particular direction, but
may be turned towards any side we please. But when once the needle is
magnetized it will point north and south; or, as we say (but not correctly), the
north pole of the magnet points to the north of the globe. It is really the
south pole that points to the north, and the north pole of the magnet points
<em>south</em>, as can be proved by suspending the bar over another magnetized
bar. So if the earth be considered a magnet our English terms are inconsistent
with our theories. Continental writers are more correct.</p>

<p>The line of the magnetic needle’s direction, which differs in different
places, is called the magnetic meridian, and the amount of its divergence
from the astronomical meridian is termed its declination or variation. When
the amount of this variation is known it is allowed for, and the needle can
be considered as pointing due north and south.</p>

<p>But the needle does not assume a position perfectly parallel to the
horizon. It dips down in different hemispheres. As we approach the
north pole the dip or inclination will become greater, and the same effect is
observable at the south pole. Again, there are certain places on the earth
where the attraction is so evenly balanced that the needle is perfectly
horizontal. The line uniting these places is the magnetic equator. This
does not coincide with the earth’s equator any more than the magnetic
poles coincide with the geographical poles of the earth.</p>

<p>The declination of the needle varies from the meridian of Greenwich at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
different times. If we travel to the west the variation increases westerly,
and is greatest in the Atlantic. It then decreases; the needle points due
north in North America. Going still forward the variation becomes easterly,
increases, and decreases to nothing in Eastern Russia. Thence the variations
are westerly. Columbus discovered the variation of the compass needle in
September 1493. In places where the needle is due north and south the
lines drawn through them are termed lines of no variation.</p>

<p>The variation, however, is not always the same in the same place. In
the year 1580, in London, for instance, the variation was 11° 11´ E. A little
more than one hundred years later London was on the line of no variation,
and now the tendency is westerly. On the other hand, there are places where
there is no deviation, and Sir John Herschell says that West India property
has been saved from litigation in consequence of the invariability of magnetic
declination there, for all surveys were made by the compass. Lines of equal
variation are called isogonial; those of equal dip or inclination, isoclinical;
and those of equal intensity, isodynamical.</p>

<p>As we have said, the magnetic elements are not always the same, and
the variations of the compass are daily and annually observed with certain
instruments. What are termed secular variations take place at long
intervals, as the following table will show:—</p>

<p>In the year 1818 therefore the maximum declination was reached in
London. In Paris the maximum was arrived at in 1814, and was
22° 34´. The rate of decrease is about 8´ a year, but varies in different
periods, as may be seen. The discovery of the fact that an annual
variation took place in the angle of declination, is attributable to Cassini,
and the diurnal variation was discovered by Graham in 1722. From
8 o’clock in the morning, when the needle is pointing a little to the
east of its “mean position,” it turns towards the west until 1 p.m. It then
returns towards the east again, and passing westerly again between midnight
and three o’clock a.m., settles down till eight a.m., when it begins afresh.
This variation does not apply to all places.</p>

<p>Magnetic inclination is besides subject to changes. There are also
variations of magnetic force which occur at very irregular periods, and
cannot be said to follow any laws. These disturbances are called Magnetic
Storms, of which the Aurora Borealis is one result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>Professor Faraday in his memorable experiments divided a long list of
different substances into para-magnetic and dia-magnetic bodies. He
classed them under these two heads, according as they took up a certain
position parallel or perpendicular to the axial or equatorial line. This
definition of “dia-magnetic” was “a body through which the lines of
magnetic force are passing, and which does not by their action assume the
usual magnetic state of iron or loadstone.” He concluded that all bodies
were magnetic, and by suspending a great number of various substances he
found they placed themselves axially,—that is, lying between the poles of
the magnet, or equatorially,—viz., at right angles to that line. If the
magnets be suspended at each side the same bodies will assume a position
with their longest diameters between the poles, while others will be repelled
by the magnets even if the poles be reversed. So those bodies which are
attracted and lie in the axial line are termed para-magnetic; those
repelled into the equatorial line are termed dia-magnetic. In the “Proceedings
of the Royal Society for 1846,” Faraday’s account of the various
experiments can be studied in detail. We can only give a brief <i lang="fr">resumé</i> of
them here; and he showed that the motions displayed by dia-magnetic
bodies in a magnetic field are all reducible to one simple law—viz., that
the particles of the dia-magnetic tend to move into the positions of the
weakest magnetic force.</p>

<p>He experimented upon a large number of bodies and gases; he tested
crystals, metals, liquids, and solids, and proved in whatever state a body
might be in the effect was the same; whether simple or compound, it made
no difference. Of course in a compound the preponderance of the dia-magnetic
or para-magnetic property would influence the result, and the medium
in which the body operated on was placed, was a condition in the experiment.
He proved that if a body be suspended in a medium or surrounded
by a medium whose power either way is stronger than the body, that
body is para-magnetic or dia-magnetic, according as it is surrounded by a
medium whose power is weaker or stronger than the body itself. The
arrangement of the bodies is as follows, from the para-magnetic to the
dia-magnetic, bismuth being the most dia-magnetic of all:—</p>

<p>Common air was also discovered to have a magnetic action, and hot air
is more dia-magnetic than cold. Oxygen is as para-magnetic in the air as
iron is on the earth, and this, it was considered, may give rise to magnetic
storms, and account for the declination of the needle.</p>

<p>We may now proceed to consider the Mariner’s Compass. The
compass, or the mariner’s compass, is so common that it is scarcely necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
to give a long description of it. Its history is unknown. The Chinese
seem to have been aware of its usefulness long before the western nations
adopted it. It was about the time of the Crusades that it was brought into
western prominence, but was not generally known till the thirteenth century.
Chinese writings ascribe to the compass a great antiquity; they maintain
that it was discovered two thousand five hundred years before the Christian
Era, and used for travelling on land. But, according to other accounts, it
was not used at sea till the year 300 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span></p>

<p>The Chinese put the south first when speaking of the points of the
compass, and in the Chinese empire and Thibet west goes likewise before
east. So the imperial edifices in China face the south, and the needle, in
their expression, points south and north—not as we say, north and south.
The antiquity of the compass may be inferred from the recorded fact in
Chinese chronicles, written in the second century before the Christian Era,
that nine hundred years previously to the date of the chronicle the Emperor
gave magnetic cars to certain ambassadors to guide them home in safety.
These cars were fitted with a magnetic needle which communicated with a
figure. Its outstretched hand and finger followed the compass-direction,
and pointed out the way.</p>

<p>The Chinese subsequently (in the twelfth century) suspended the needle
by a thread, and it is said their philosophers at that time noticed the variation
of the needle. But Columbus first, in 1492, and Cabot, in 1540,
certainly remarked it in Europe. It is to Marco Polo that we are indebted
for the direct introduction of the needle into Europe, although it probably
had been in use in the Levant previously, for we have seen a quotation by
an Arab writer, who, in 1242, described the needle as being used at that
time on his voyage from Tripoli in Syria to Alexandria, two years previously.</p>

<p>Friar Bacon possessed a loadstone, and there are many instances in
which it is referred to in ancient writings. The inventor of the compass we
cannot trace, but no doubt exists as to its being of Chinese origin.</p>

<p>The ordinary compass is shown in the illustration herewith (fig. 265). It
consists of a magnetized needle, suspended freely, and fixed to a circular card,
which is divided and subdivided into thirty-two points, as in the cut. This
compass is suspended upon gimbals to keep it in an upright position when
the vessel rolls or plunges. The gimbals are concentric rings, the compass
being fastened to the inner one, and keeps its position in all weathers. It
is then enclosed in the binnacle, a glass receptacle. The card moves with the
needle which points north. There is a dark line (lubber line) which indicates
the ship’s course, and when sailing the steersman must keep that line opposite
the compass direction-point which indicates the course. At night a lamp is
lighted in the binnacle, and the card being transparent and the points opaque
they are easily seen.</p>

<p>The magnetism of iron ships has a tendency to disturb the needle, and
many suggestions have been made and discussed with a view to obviate this.
To put the compass at the mast-head was one, to surround the compass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
with “counter-irritants” another. But the usual way is to “swing the ship,” and
so adjust the compass. Swinging the ship means turning her round point by
point, and marking the deflection of the needle with reference to a certain
object. The amount of deflection at each point is read and noted, and
subsequently taken into consideration when sailing.</p>

<p>The Azimuth Compass is a mariner’s compass fitted with brass uprights
slit through the centre, through which the heavenly bodies may be seen.
These are the <em>sights</em>. The card is divided into
<em>degrees</em> and <em>quarters</em>. A fine wire is fixed upon
one of the sights, and in the other slit is a prism
to reflect the divisions of the card to the eye.
The object—the azimuth distance of which it is
desirable to know—is looked at through the slit,
and bisected by the wire. The divisions of the
scale are at the same time reflected, and the
number read gives the azimuth distance required.</p>

</div>

<p>The compass has led us away slightly from
our consideration of the electro-magnet, but we
will now examine it and its effects as briefly as possible.</p>

<p>An electro-magnet is formed by wrapping a copper wire round a piece
of soft iron shaped like a horse-shoe; the wire should be insulated with silk.
If the wire be wound round the iron in the same direction, and a current be
merely sent through the coil, it will be found that the horse-shoe iron is highly
magnetic, but if the current be stopped the power is lost. Such magnets
will carry weights much heavier than themselves, and by careful consideration
of certain laws, and with reference to the number of
coils and the strength of the current, these magnets will
sustain a weight some thousands of times greater than
their own weight.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_260b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 266.—Electro-Magnet.</div>
</div>

<p>If we cover a non-magnetic piece of iron with a
wire coil, and taking a magnet turn it rapidly beneath
the wire-bound iron, so that the magnetic poles approach
each other alternately, an electrical current will be
generated in the wire. The electro-magnetic machine
is thus made; but although strong currents may be
generated as a source of motive power it is a failure.</p>

<p>To Faraday our knowledge of magneto-electricity is due. “He knew”
(says Professor Tyndall in his interesting work, “Faraday as a Discoverer”)
“that under ordinary circumstances the presence of an electrified body
was sufficient to excite by induction an unelectrified body. He knew
that the wire which carried an electric current was an electrified body, and
still all attempts had failed to make it excite in other wires a state similar
to its own.”</p>

<p>But while he was making his experiments on the induction of electric
currents he noticed that at the time the current was passing from the battery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
through the coils of wire that no motion was perceptible in the galvanometer.
But when the circuit was opened, and when it was closed, there was a slight
motion of the needle in the galvanometer, but in different directions. After
consideration the philosopher came to the conclusion “that a battery current
through one wire induced a similar current through the other, but for an
instant only.”</p>

<p>Œrsted had already demonstrated that all magnetic effects were
attributable to the attraction and repulsion of electric currents; and founding
his views upon the theory of Ampère, Faraday came to the conclusion that
electricity could be produced from magnetism, or that the electric current
could be obtained from magnets. This he succeeded in doing. By inserting
a steel magnet about half its length into a coil of wire, Faraday induced a
current to pass through the wire in two directions. Thus he proceeded to
solve all the mysteries of magneto-electricity, and stated that to produce
currents it was only necessary to “cut appropriately the lines of magnetic
force.”</p>

<p>The application of the magnet to the machines for electric lighting will be
shown further on. Very powerful currents are obtained by the induction coil;
but the currents would not be of practical service were it not for the apparatus
called a Commutator, or key, which reverses the connection of the bobbins,
and turns the current at every half revolution. Just as if a current were being
sent across and back over a table, and when the current has reached the end,
an instantaneous <em>wheel round</em>, or pivoting of the table, <em>sends the current on</em>, in
continuation (but on the table all the time), because of the sudden change of
its position. The back rush being on the table, the movement of the latter
really makes the line continuous, and by quickly breaking and reversing the
current in the commutator, the effect is gained in the machine.</p>

<p class="hang">SUNDRY ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES—MR. EDISON’S INVENTIONS—THE
ELECTRIC LIGHT—THE GYROSCOPE—A NEW ELECTROPHORUS—ELECTRIC
TOYS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Electro-Motograph</span>—although perhaps even yet scarcely developed—has
already proved a very useful invention. The idea of it first occurred
to Mr. Edison in 1873, when he was prosecuting some researches in
chemical telegraphy. “One day,” says Mr. Fox, in his account of the
invention, “as he sat pondering over his work, he happened to take in
hand the metallic point through which, as it rested upon the paper, the
current was wont to pass. When again he closed the circuit to let the
current through the paper, he held the metallic point loosely, and unintentionally
allowed it to rest upon the paper. Every time he moved the
metallic strip on the paper the latter became wonderfully smooth. Edison
was determined to find the reason of this, and he decided that the electricity
very much lessened the friction of the metal on the paper. He made many
experiments, and brought the subject before the Royal Society in 1874, but
nothing came of the idea till 1876, when Edison was perfecting his musical
telephone.</p>

<p>“The new appliance is, in fact, the same invention revived and now
perfected by the original inventor, and brought to complete practical success
under the title of the ‘electro-motograph.’ The action of the ‘electro-motograph’
depends on the fact, discovered during former experiments, and
employed imperfectly in the musical telephone, that the friction of moving
bodies varies in greater or less degree with their electrical condition. In
the electro-motograph a cylinder made of prepared chalk, and saturated
with a strong solution of caustic alkali, is set upon supports, so that it can
be turned upon its axis. A strip of metal fastened to the mica diaphragm
rests on the cylinder, and is pressed so firmly by its spring upon the
cylinder that when it is turned by means of the handle the friction of the
strip on the cylinder tends to pull the diaphragm out of shape, causing it
to bulge inward as long as the cylinder is in motion. If now, while this
motion of the cylinder is maintained, an electric current passes through the
strip of metal, and then through the chalk cylinder to earth, the amount
of this friction is varied or it is destroyed altogether, and the strip slides
freely on the cylinder. This was the basis of the former invention. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
release from friction by a change in electric condition in the first instrument
failed simply from ignorance of some slight matters of detail, that in the
electro-motograph are corrected and made practical. In the musical
telephone the releasing of the frictional resistance by electric action caused
the sounding-board of a guitar to vibrate, and thus set up sonorous vibrations.
In the electro-motograph the mica disc takes the place of the guitar,
and, by the improved construction of the apparatus, intricate and complex
vibrations, such as are produced in speaking, are reproduced in their
original or even in greater volume. When the apparatus is at rest the
diaphragm is motionless, and electric currents shot through the apparatus
produce no effect. In the same manner the mere turning of the cylinder
without electric action produces no effect, except to pull the diaphragm
slightly out of shape. If while the cylinder is being turned an electric
impulse arrives, the pull on the diaphragm, caused by the friction of the
strip on the cylinder, is more or less released, and the diaphragm is free to
vibrate or spring back into its original condition. If now, the electric
impulses follow one another in regular order in correspondence with the
sonorous vibrations imparted to the transmitting telephone, the alternate
slipping and catching of the metal strip on the cylinder will follow in the
same order, and thus the diaphragm will be made to vibrate in unison with
the original vibrations, and thus reproduce the original words. As the
mica disc is much larger than the disc of the transmitting instrument, the
amplitude of its swing may be much greater, and consequently it will repeat
the words with greater power. The electro-motograph is practically an
apparatus for transforming electric action received from a distance into
mechanical work. The amount of electric action has nothing to do with
the amount of the mechanical work performed, because the movement of
the cylinder is controlled by power independently of the electric action, the
electricity merely releasing this power by destroying the friction in greater
or less degree. The electric action set up by the sonorous vibrations at the
transmitting end of the line may be very slight, while the mechanical action
at the distant end may be powerful, and in this manner the amplitude of
the vibrations may be increased to an indefinite extent, and a whisper may
reappear as a loud shout.</p>

<p>“The electro-motograph is not only a solution of the telephone, making
it capable of sounds of every quality and pitch and in greatly increased
volume, but by this conversion of electrical action into mechanical work
at a distance makes it possible to unite the telephone and phonograph.
Telephonic messages by the electro-motograph may be impressed upon a
self-acting (clock-work) phonograph, the same current starting and stopping
the phonograph after the manner of the stock-reporting machines, and
afterward the phonograph may be made to repeat the message impressed
upon it.”</p>

<p>[The above extract, which explains the principle fully, has been taken from
a long article on the subject which formerly appeared in <cite>Scribner’s Magazine</cite>.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>The uses to which the electro-motograph may be applied are various.
It can produce mechanical motion even at a distance, and is useful to lessen
friction by machinery; and in this way its service to railways and other
locomotive systems may be estimated. It is a great help to telegraphy
by increasing the speed of transmission, and can ascertain the beatings of
the heart of the apparently dead. It amplifies sound in a much greater
degree than the microphone, by which even a fly can be heard moving. In
fact, the limit of the usefulness of this wonderful machine has not been
reached.</p>

<p>Another very ingenious apparatus has been developed by Professor
Bell. This is for the purpose of ascertaining the position of bullets in the
body. The following is condensed from the <cite>Times</cite>:—</p>

<p>“Two conductors are used, and the ball completes the circuit.
Professor Bell inserts a fine needle in the suspected region. It is connected
by wire with one of the binding screws of a telephone, which the
surgeon holds to his ear; the other binding screw being connected with a
metallic mass applied to the skin. When the needle point touches the ball,
an electric couple is formed, and the current generates the sound in the
telephone. The surgeon may then use his knife with confidence, guided by
the needle. He may make several insertions of the needle if necessary
without danger, and any pain may be obviated by etherization. This
simple method (which should prove useful on the field of battle) was tried
with success with a lead ball introduced into a piece of beef. Contact of
the needle with bone had no effect, but a very distinct sound was heard
each time the ball was reached. A modification consists in inserting a
vibrator in the circuit; this gives a musical note in the telephone at each
contact of ball and needle. Again, if the circuit include a battery, the
telephone sounds may be heard by several persons at once. A sound is
heard, in this case, whenever the needle enters the skin; but, on reaching
the ball, it is much intensified, owing to lessened resistance. A galvanometer
may be used in place of the telephone.”</p>

<p>Mr. C. Vernon Boys has exhibited and described a very ingenious new
integrating machine of his invention, and its application as a measurer of the
electric energy in the circuit of an electric lamp or a dynamo-electric motor.
Mr. Boys’ mechanical integrator belongs to the class termed tangent machines,
and consists essentially of a small disc or wheel running along the surface of
a drum or cylinder. When the wheel runs straight along the drum parallel
to its axis there is no rotation of the latter, but when the wheel is inclined
to the axis the drum rotates, and the integral is represented by the amount
of rotation. Continuous action is secured in giving the drum a reciprocating
motion along its axis, so that when the wheel has travelled to one end
of the cylinder it can travel back again. The new integrator is especially
adapted for measuring forces which are either delicate or variable. It is
applied by causing the varying force to be measured to vary in a corresponding
manner the inclination of the wheel to the axis of the rotating cylinder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
In this way it can be used to find the work done by a fluid pressure reciprocating
engine, or the energy transmitted by a shaft or belt from one part of
a factory to another. By making the wheel very small and light, the strength
of an electric current may be continuously measured, if the disc is inclined
by means of the needle of a galvanometer in circuit. Mr. Boys has constructed
on the same principle an electric energy meter, which integrates the
product of the strength of current and the difference of potential between
two points with respect to time. In it the current is passed through a pair
of concentric solenoids or coils of wire, and in the annular space between
these is hung a third solenoid, the upper half of which is wound in the
opposite direction to its lower half. By the use of what Mr. Boys calls
“induction traps” of soft iron, the magnetic force is confined to a small
portion of the suspended solenoid, and by this means the attracting force of
the fixed solenoids upon it is independent of position. The middle solenoid
is hung from the end of a balance beam, and its motion is retarded by a
counterweight, which admits of regulating the meter to give standard measure
as a clock gives standard time. The motion of the beam is caused to incline
the integrating wheel, and the rotation of the cylinder gives the energy
expended in foot-pounds by means of an indicator or diagram, as the case
may be. The object in giving an equal number of turns in opposite directions
to the suspended solenoid is to render the instrument insensible to
external magnetic forces.</p>

<p>We have, in a former portion of this work, explained the construction
of the telephone and phonograph with other inventions to make sounds
audible at a distance, so we need not repeat the explanations here. A brief
reference to them will, however, be found in this chapter, in which the
electro-magnet and the methods of lighting by magneto-electric machines
are treated of. We will proceed to give some particulars concerning the
electric light before considering the means by which it is produced, as such
an arrangement is more convenient.</p>

<p>The light is very easily produced by uniting and then separating the
terminals of a strong battery. The passage of the electric current induces
intense heat and a most brilliant light. But if this were continued the wires
would melt, and therefore some non-fusible substance is placed at the ends
of the wires, which will be at once a conductor and infusible. Now in gas-carbon
(the deposited substance found in gas retorts) we have a substance
suited to these conditions. The carbon is heated to an intense brightness,
and particles of it are passed across the arc of flame almost in a state of
fusion. Combustion does not actually take place, because it has been proved
that the wires will give out light under water, and in the vacuum of an air-pump
the light is even increased, so that had the oxygen of the air any part in the
production of the light it would not remain unaffected under these conditions.
The heat arising from this Voltaic arc is intense, and even platinum may be
fused with the assistance of the gas carbon. The carbon points are of course
liable to be worn away, and one side more than another. The positive pole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
is generally more concave than the other, for it sheds its particles in a greater
degree, and is the more intensely heated. The electric light first appeared
in public at the opera in Paris in 1836, to illustrate a sunrise, but it was
not till 1843 that it was experimented upon in the open air. We need not
trace it farther at present, for a full account of its origin, rise, and progress
is published in a small shilling volume by Messrs. Ward, Lock, &amp; Co. We
will proceed to the methods of bringing out the light.</p>

<p>There are various lamps, many of which required a regulator in consequence
of the wearing away of the carbon points, as already explained.
We append two illustrations of the Maxim lamp, the invention of Hiram
Maxim, of New York. In both cuts the letters refer to the same portions.</p>

<p>In the first illustration (fig. 267), A and B are the positive and
negative carbon-holders respectively, and the carbon points are controlled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
by an armature, which is, in its turn, adjusted by the screw, <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>. When it
happens that the magnetic force is reduced the spring acts and permits the
points to approach again, and the light is rekindled; the carbons are then
locked till required to move. The second illustration (fig. 268) shows a
section of the lamp with the wheel arrangements for controlling the advance
of the carbon points as they waste away.</p>

<p>In the “Brush” light, which is in use in London, and is fitted for large
spaces, the carbon points are held by a
regulator side by side, and they last
eight hours without renewal. The
power is generated by an electro-dynamic
engine. We give illustrations
of the lamps of Wallace and
Houston (figs. 269, 270). The current
is conveyed through <i>b</i> and the magnet,
<i>m</i>. The armature, <i>a</i>, separates the
electrodes, and the weakened current is
restored by <i>b</i>, and the light continues.
The pillar, <i>p</i>, is hollow, with a wire
running through it. The positive electrode
is supported by <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span>, the negative by <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>; <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span> is a button which comes
in contact with the lever, <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>, when the carbon points are exhausted, and
cuts the lamp out of the circuit by passing it direct through mercury cups.</p>

<p>The Jablochkoff candle and chandelier are also represented (figs. 271,
272). The candles consist of carbons connected at the top, but otherwise
insulated, and fixed in a socket. They do not last very long without
renewal. The exhibition at the Crystal Palace will be essentially an Electric
Light Exhibition, and all the latest forms can be studied there. The great
attraction will doubtless be, as at Paris, the varied and numerous inventions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
of Mr. Edison. The early career of that American “magician” is now
tolerably well known; his tremendous energy and application are fully
appreciated. With only a few months schooling all his life he has taken a
foremost place in the scientific world. In ten years he has invented
the phonograph, the electric pen, a system of fast telegraphy,
the electro-motograph, the telephone, a tasimeter, and other useful
applications of electricity, besides solving the problem of electric light
for domestic purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. Edison’s electric light<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> requires something more than a
passing notice, and we will therefore endeavour to give a sketch of
the general subject. Now that the electric light has been made
available for domestic purposes, and the very simple lamp (consisting
of an exhausted glass globe, two platinum wires, and a piece of
charred paper) can be obtained, people will no doubt soon largely
adopt electric lighting in their houses. The light has found a success
at the theatre, in the streets, and in the train; there is no reason
why it should not be adopted generally, being more economical and
more healthy than gas.</p>

<p>If we sever an electric wire, and bring the ends, tipped with
carbon, into juxtaposition, we obtain a brilliant light. This is the
Voltaic arc we have already mentioned, produced by the incandescence
of finely-divided matter; it was the first method of illuminating by electricity,
and was discovered by Sir Humphrey Davy, who obtained a very brilliant
light, but at great expense—about a guinea a minute!
But the Daniell and Grove batteries and generators, and
modern improvements in 1860, brought the use of the
electric light into prominence. Faraday lighted a lighthouse
with its assistance.</p>

<p>But when the <span class="smcap">Gramme Generator</span> was invented the
needed impetus was applied. The Jablochkoff candles
followed, and now we have the electric light in full operation.
So far we have sketched the history of illumination by the
Voltaic arc, and descriptions of the various apparatus will be
found at the end of this chapter. But the method of lighting
with an incandescent solid was introduced in 1845 by Starr
and Peabody, who took out a patent for the use of platinum.
Later on Drs. Draper and Despretz made experiments with
platinum and carbon. The latter gentleman sealed the
carbon in an exhausted globe, and then introduced nitrogen
in place of the air. But the method died out and was forgotten,
and in 1873 a medal was actually given by the Academy of
St. Petersburg for the “discovery” to Messrs. Sawyer and Mann.</p>

<p>In 1878 Paris was lighted with the electric candles of Jablochkoff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
This application of electricity stirred up our transatlantic cousins, and
Mr. Edison was requested—backed up by many influential persons—to
make the investigation whether the light could be produced for domestic
purposes. The celebrated electrician undertook the commission, and certainly
came unprejudiced to the encounter, for he had not at that time even
seen an electric light.</p>

<p>He perceived at once that “permanence in the lamp and the subdivision
of the light” were the two desiderata. He put the Voltaic arc
aside as unsuitable, and addressed himself to the problem of obtaining the
desired results from an incandescent solid. The subdivision of the light is
really an important point, and a comparison between divided and undivided
burners is in favour of the more diffused light in a number of burners. This
subdivision Edison worked hard to secure, and, as it is said of him, “With
a steadfast faith in the fulness of nature, a profound conviction that if a
new substance were demanded for the carrying out of some beneficial
project, that substance need only be sought for, he set to work.”</p>

<p>Mr. Edison found difficulties in his way. One was the apparent
impossibility of illuminating by means of an incandescent solid, for even
platinum will melt at a heat too low for use. But this apparent impossibility
was overcome by the inventor’s genius. He,
after many trials, found that if he raised the platinum
to a white heat <em>in a vacuum</em> he would practically obtain
<em>a new metal</em> which would sustain the required heat.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_269a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 273.—Edison’s platinum lamp.</div>
</div>

<p>“In making an electric lamp without a regulator,”
says Mr. Upton, “two things are essential,—great
resistance in the wire, and a small radiating
surface. Mr. Edison sought to combine these two
essential conditions by using a considerable quantity
of insulated platinum wire wound like thread on a
spool.” This platinum, as shown in the accompanying
cut (fig. 273), was suspended in a glass bulb <i lang="la">in vacuo</i>,
the air contained in it being expelled by electricity,
heating it, and suddenly cooling the platinum, and
squeezing out the air by the process. But, after all,
the great difficulty of the inventor was to insulate his
wires so perfectly that they would not meet and
become a conductor. For, to perfect his lamp, this
non-conducting principle was a necessity, otherwise
the current would flow across instead of going all
along the wires. He had previously made many uses
of carbon, which we know is infusible. He tried
lampblack tar, but it contained air, and would not do.</p>

<p>Thread answered his purpose, but was too fragile and uneven in texture.
It suddenly occurred to him that paper—<em>charred paper</em>—cut into a thread-like
form would satisfy all his conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>The problem was solved—the lamp was a fact. But how can paper,
so easily burned, answer? We will endeavour to explain. “A piece of
charred paper, cut into horse-shoe shape, so delicate that it looked like a fine
wire firmly clamped to the two ends of the conducting and discharging
wires, so as to form part of the electric circuit, proved to be the long-sought
combination.”</p>

<p>We will now explain the construction of this little lamp, which is
shown in the illustration (fig. 274) one-half of its actual size. The illuminating
is equal to ten or twelve ordinary gas jets.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_270.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 274.—Edison’s electric lamp.</div>
</div>

<p>The manner in which the paper is prepared is, like many other very
important inventions, extremely simple, and, we may
add, almost costless. Cardboard will furnish us with
the loops, and these “horseshoes” are placed in layers
in an iron box with tissue paper between each. The
box is then hermetically sealed, and made red hot.
The carbonized paper remains till all the air has been
got rid of, and although it will burn freely to ashes in
atmospheric air, <em>in the vacuum prepared for it</em> it is
never consumed. That is the plain fact—the secret
of the Edison lamp.</p>

<p>A vacuum can now be produced almost perfect.
It is of course impossible to extract every tiny particle
of air from the globes, but by the Sprengel pump, in
which mercury is employed, excellent vacuums are
obtained. Several very curious phenomena have been
observed in these vacuums, and the Royal Society has
been engaged upon their consideration. Another advantage
of the vacuum, as applied by Edison, is that
little or no heat is generated. The electricity is all,
or very nearly all, converted into light. Thus the
glass globes remain almost unheated, and are unbroken.</p>

<p>The electric current passes along the wire, <span class="smcap lowercase">W</span>,
and at a certain place marked <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, the copper is
soldered to a platinum wire, which enters at <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, and so by platinum clamps
into the horse-shoe, <span class="smcap lowercase">L</span>. The return wire is similarly arranged; the carbon
is enclosed in a glass bulb, <span class="smcap lowercase">GG</span>, and all the air is extracted by the pumps;
the end is then sealed up by melting it at <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span>.</p>

<p>The world is now in possession of a lamp for household use, and we
are surprised that it is not more extensively adopted in England. There
are some Swan lamps used in parts of the British Museum, and when we
have explained the application of the light, and the uses to which the motive
power can be applied, we shall, we believe, convince the most conservative
gas bill advocate that Edison’s lamp is cheaper, safer, and far better in
illuminating power than gas, if the success of the electric lamp can be assured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>We need not dwell upon the construction of the “pumping station,”
for that is virtually what the magneto-electric generator is. Several of these
stations can be established in various parts of the city, and each station will
supply a district with electricity. The wires are laid in a tight box along
the street, beneath the footpath, or other convenient position, and we are
informed that the frost rather improves their electrical condition. Here is
one advantage over gas.</p>

<p>From the main wires smaller ones enter the houses, and are carried
through a “meter” containing a safety valve. There are two wires—a
distributing wire and a waste—coloured, one red and the other green, which
communicate respectively with the main supply and return wires to the
“pumping station” or generator. The electricity is admitted between
carbon points and flows round a magnet, the armature of which is held above
it by a spring. If too much force be put on and any danger incurred, the
magnet will attract the armature, and the current will cease. A snap connected
by a small wire will then be closed by the electricity, and melting
from the heat will cut off all the current. In ordinary circumstances the
electricity passes through regulators (wire wound on spools) and on to a copper
plate, “through a solution of copper salt.” Thus for every unit of current
a certain quantity of copper is deposited. A certain standard amount
represents five cubic feet, and the bills, based on the accumulation of copper,
are made out like gas bills.</p>

<p>When the lamp is required a small handle is turned, and is instantly
lighted; the reverse motion cuts off the current. “By touching a knob in
the bedroom the whole house can be simultaneously lighted up” if desirable.
No matches are necessary, as the lamps light themselves.</p>

<p>By adding a small electro-motor to the furniture of the house, and
turning a handle, the sewing-machine can be worked by electricity, or lathes
turned; and any business operations, such as lifting by cranes, etc., can be
easily carried on.</p>

<p>The Swan electric lamps, which, with Mr. Edison’s, were exhibited in
Paris, and will be found at Sydenham, give about twelve candle-power light.
Edison’s lamps are made in two sizes, and vary accordingly. The Swan
lamps give a very soft light, and are as easily manipulated as Edison’s. The
Siemens system of lighting was also well seen in Paris, and the Faure storage
system enables our trains to be lighted instantaneously by simply turning a
handle. A full description of the <em>Faure</em> battery was given in the <em>Times</em> by
Sir William Thomson, and in his address to the British Association at York
in September last. He pointed out that in the accumulators of M. Faure,—which
can be seen at 446, West Strand, London,—by means of a large
battery it is quite easy to draw off electricity and to apply it as Edison
proposed to do, in lighting our houses and do any little service. The
electricity thus stored would be always ready for use, and would be supplied
and paid for. It can be applied to any purpose, and locomotion by its
means will ere long become more general. In Paris Dr. Siemens exhibited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
his electric tramway. This was an improvement upon the first Berlin tramway,
for in it the horses frequently received shocks which they resented. In
the later application the current comes from the generator by metal rods
carried above the heads of the passengers alongside the line. Little rollers
upon these are united with an electric machine in the tram-car. The current
is sent along the wires, and reconverted into mechanical energy in the second
machine, turns the wheels of the cars. In this way, as the car proceeds, the
rollers overhead or alongside the track are kept moving by the car, and the
connection is never broken.</p>

<p>But this is a digression. The electric light as applied to lighthouses
was also exhibited, and any reader desirous to obtain full information upon
the subject of lights and lighthouses will find it in a very pleasantly-written
work by Mr. Thomas Stevenson, in which the various systems of lighting by
electricity and otherwise are fully recounted, the conclusion being in favour
of electricity, which is employed and has been used for years in France and
in some English beacons. If its penetrative power can be finally established,—for
some authorities maintain that the electric is more easily absorbed
by fog than other light,—there is no doubt about its being universally
adopted.</p>

<p>It is very interesting to watch the uses to which the electric light is
being put. The latest experiment has been made by an Austrian, Doctor
Mikerliez. Almost incredible as it may seem, the interior of the human
stomach can now be illuminated by means of a wonderful little instrument
called the Gastroscope, which is said to be actually in use and to have been
favourably reported upon by the medical faculty of Vienna. There is at the
end of a jointed flexible tube (which can be passed down the gullet) a
miniature lamp, far more marvellous and mysterious than that of Aladdin,
in which a strip of platinum is fixed and connected with fine wires conducting
the electricity from a small battery. When contact is made, and the
“light turned on,” the cavernous interior of the stomach is lit up. Still more
extraordinary is the fact that the tube can be made to revolve, and the light
reflected from the walls of the stomach and directed to the eye of the
observer. There is necessarily a bend in the instrument, so that the light
has literally to turn a corner before it reaches the surgeon’s eye; here the
inventor’s skill and thorough knowledge of the laws of optics are brought
into requisition. The reflected rays of light fall upon a sort of window
situated a little above the lantern, and by means of prisms and a series of
lenses, the light is twisted and turned about until it arrives at the eye-piece.
No sensation of heat is to be feared, the little lamp being kept constantly
cool by a reservoir of water.</p>

<p>Several contrivances have been invented within the last few years for
examining the interior of the body, but they are very costly; the Gastroscope
is likely to render great service to medical science.</p>

<p>The term “magneto-electric machine” is given to a collection of parts
of mechanism intended to create or gather together induced electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
currents. The invention of the magneto-electric machine was by no means
a sudden inspiration, but the gradual result of a series of experiments and
discoveries, the first of which, dating from 1820, may be said to be Œrsted’s
observation, that a magnetised needle is deflected by the approach of an electric
current as well as by that of a magnet, clearly proving that magnetism
and electricity have some relation to one another. In the same year
Arago discovered that a coil of insulated wire wound round a core of soft
iron, converts it into a powerful magnet (<i>i.e.</i>, an electro-magnet) when a
current passes through the coil. It was in 1830, however, that our countryman
Faraday proved the creation of a current by the action of a magnet on
a coil of wire, and his experiment proved shortly as follows:—If a coil of
wire be wound on a hollow core, and a permanent bar magnet be introduced
into the hollow core, whilst introducing it a current may be proved (by a
galvanometer), to be induced in the coil flowing in a certain direction, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>,
which ceases as soon as the magnet is at rest in the centre of coil. On the
withdrawal of the magnet a second current is induced flowing in the opposite
direction, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>. Therefore it is clear that if a magnet be incessantly
approached to and withdrawn from a coil of wire a constant succession of
currents will be produced, and if a charged coil (<i>i.e.</i>, a coil connected with
the poles of a voltaic battery) take the place of the magnet a precisely
similar result will be obtained. Now it will have been noticed that two
opposite currents are constantly being formed, and as the object is to obtain
a continuous flow of electricity in <em>one given direction</em>, or, in fact, divert or
reverse the current instantly on its formation to make it practically the
same current, for this purpose a commutator is used, and as for most purposes
a commutator is one of the essentials of a magneto-electric machine,
we will here give a description thereof. (<i>See</i> fig. 275.) The machine is
composed of a cylinder, consisting of two metallic conducting halves,
separated by a non-conducting layer. Whilst it is at rest the alternating
currents, from being connected with the halves by the current, will pass to
the two contact springs, and thence through the circuit. Now if (as is the
case) the current is constantly changing, as has been noticed, the inverse
current will at the first change pass through the same channels, but in
another direction; but if at the instant of the reversal of the current the
cylinder be revolved, the current flowing the reverse way will be guided
through other channels respectively, instead of the original channels, and the
direction of the current being changed at the same moment as the current
itself, the two inversions neutralize themselves, and one constant current is
produced. In a magneto-electric machine the commutator revolves identically
with the magnet or armature, and the point at which sparks are being
constantly produced is where the contact is being continually broken and
made by the passage of the friction springs from over the non-conducting
layer. The first machine formed on the basis of Faraday’s experiments
was Pixii’s. It was composed of two uprights and a cross bar, to which is
attached, hanging poles downwards, an electro-magnet; underneath this, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
poles upwards, revolves a magnet. The commutator is fixed on the same
axle and revolves with the permanent magnet. Saxton, and subsequently
Clarke, made the obvious improvement of making the magnet less cumbrous
and fixed, and causing the bobbins of the electro-magnet to revolve before or
rather beside its poles; the commutator was fixed at the end of the axle on
which the revolving bobbins (or armature) are fixed. Niaudat formed a
compound Clarke machine, by setting two horse-shoe magnets a short
distance apart. The armature revolves between them, and consists of
twelve coils set between two plates; the coils are set alternately and connected,—<i>i.e.</i>,
the poles of the electro-magnets are set beside one another,—N.
to S., S. to N., and so on, so that the N. pole receding produces a current;
<em>but</em> the N. pole receding makes the S. pole approach, and produces another
current, <span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span>; in fact, a continuation of the same, for the <em>approach</em> of a
N. pole naturally produces the same current as the recession of a S. pole;
then as the S. pole in turn recedes it produces an inverse current, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, which
is in turn kept up by the approach of the next N. pole, and so on. Each coil
is attached to a radiating metal bar, which conveys the current to be redirected
to the commutator, which is affixed to the axle of the revolving armature as
in Clarke’s machine. In 1854 Siemens completed his machine, the chief
peculiarity of which was its cylindrical bobbin; the core is grooved deeply,
parallel with its axis, and the wire is wound on cylindrically and covered
with plates of brass; one end of the coil is fixed to the metal axis, the
other to an insulated ferule at the end of the axis, where is also situate the
commutator. This armature revolves between the poles by which it is
closely embraced. One of the most celebrated of the magneto-electrical
machines is that known as the “Alliance,” invented by Nollet, and perfected by
Van Malderen. It is composed of four or six bronze discs, revolving on an
axle, round the external circumference of each of which are set sixteen
bobbins. This rotating compound armature revolves between four to six
sets of horse-shoe magnets, which, being fixed radially to the centre, present
in each set sixteen poles to the sixteen bobbins. It will be readily understood
that this immense quantity of poles and bobbins produces a highly
concentrated current, the ends of which proceed from the axle and an
insulated ferule at its extremity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_275.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 275.—The Wallace Machine.</div>
</div>

<p>In 1869 Mr. Holmes perfected his machine, which differs from all previous
ones (except Pixii’s), in that the electro-magnets revolve in front of
the coils instead of <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>; and besides magnetising his electro-magnets
with part of the self-produced electricity, his bobbins are so disposed as to
be able to keep several independent lights going at once. The Wylde
machine consists, as it were, of two Siemens machines, one on the top of the
other, the lower and larger of which is worked by an electro-magnet, which
is magnetised by the action of the upper or smaller one, consisting in the
ordinary way of a permanent magnet apparatus, which is termed “the exciting
machine.” The longitudinal bobbin revolved between these permanent
poles produces alternating currents, which are commutated (or redirected), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
pass to work the larger and lower electro-magnet, which is composed of two
large sheets of iron connected by a plate (on which stands the exciter). Its
poles are two masses of iron separated by a layer of copper, and in this
armature revolves the larger longitudinal bobbin. This lower machine is
called the generator. Both bobbins are simultaneously revolved, and an
intense current of electricity is thereby generated. Almost simultaneously
with this one Mr. Ladd invented his machine, which is distinguished from all
hitherto described by being composed of two parallel <em>bar</em> electro-magnets,
between the extremities of which are placed two Siemens armatures, one
smaller than the other; both being revolved, the smaller excites the electro-magnets,
and the larger generates the electricity required. The wire is
wound round the magnets so that the N. and S. poles face each other at
each end. The chief advantage of the Ladd machine is the conversion of
dynamic force into electricity, there always being just sufficient magnetism
in an iron bar (by induction from terrestrial magnetism and other causes) to
produce a very feeble current in the Siemens bobbin, and the bobbin taking
it up and returning it to the electro-magnet, and the electro-magnet at once
giving it back to the bobbin, the current gradually increases till the maximum
is reached. And when we take into consideration this modicum of utilisable
terrestrial magnetism, we may truly say in the words of M. Hippolyte
Fontaine, “The mind is lost in contemplation of the succession of discoveries
completing one another, and showing that with apparatus of small dimensions
an infinite source of electricity could be produced if matter could withstand
infinite velocities.” The Lontin machine, which supplied the current for the
electric light which used to make night bright outside the Gaiety, is also
composed of two parts, one dividing, the other generating the electricity
produced. The principle of the dividing machine is somewhat similar to
the alliance, excepting that a number of electro-magnets arranged radially
round a core, revolve close to a corresponding number of bobbins fixed
inside an iron cylinder, outside which is the collecting and dividing apparatus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
The Maxim machine is constructed on the principle of sets of coils rotating
between powerful electro-magnets. The Wallace machine was invented by the
inventor of the Wallace-Farmer lamp. It consists of two horse-shoe electro-magnets
placed side by side, the opposing poles facing each other. Each
magnet has a rotating armature of twenty-five bobbins, on which the wire is
wound quadruply, and the current generated by these coils is conducted
away, passing through and exciting the electro-magnets, thus utilizing the
residual and terrestrial magnetism before mentioned in connection with the
Ladd machine; otherwise it partakes of the nature of the Niaudet machine.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 276.—The Gramme Machine.</div>
</div>

<p>We now come to what is perhaps the most perfect magneto-electric
machine, which was first constructed by M. Gramme, a Parisian, in 1872,
and differs in principle and construction from all those hitherto noticed. Its
essential characteristic is a soft iron ring, round which is coiled one single
continuous wire (<i>i.e.</i>, the two ends are joined). Round the exterior surface
of the wire coil a band is bared, and on this bared part two friction springs
act. If the ring and coil be placed before the poles of a magnet, the ring
will have two poles, S. and N., induced opposite the opposing poles N. and
S. of the magnet; and if the ring revolve the poles will remain stationary,
and as the coil revolves each coil of the wire will pass this induced pole, and
as naturally half the coil will be inducted with one current, the other half
(acted on by the other pole) will be charged with another or opposite
current, which two kinds of electricity are carried away by the friction springs
before mentioned. In the machine, as actually constructed, the soft iron ring
is composed like the magnet or wire bundle of an induction coil, and the
coils are set upon it side by side. Inside the ring are radially set insulated
pieces, to each of which is attached the issuing end of one and the entering
end of another bobbin; these answer the same purpose as the denudation of
the external layer of wire. These pieces are bent so as to come out of the
centre of the ring at right angles, and lay side by side (insulated) round a
small cylinder. These, as they revolve, are touched by friction springs, which
draw off the electricity induced in the coils in one continuous current. No
sparks are produced at the contact of the friction springs, and there is no
tendency to become heated. To obviate the inconvenience of the secondary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
or inverted current produced by the stopping of the machine, the inventor
has contrived a circuit breaker on the principle of the electro-magnet, the
magnets holding the circuit breaker in contact so long as the machine is
working; but the decrease of velocity lessening the attractive power of the
magnet, the circuit breaker opens by its own weight (or a counter-weight),
and all danger of a reverse current is obviated. Experimental machines are
manufactured by Bréquet &amp; Cie (Paris), composed of Jamin’s magnets, and
turned with a handle, and produce a force of eight Bunsen cells.</p>

<p>A great revolution, or rather the beginning of a new era in the history of
electricity, may be said to have commenced with the perfection of M. Faure’s
accumulators. These are troughs containing eleven lead plates, each coated
with oxide of lead and wrapped in felt, the fluid being dilute sulphuric acid.
The application of them to the electric light is one of their most valuable
features; at the depôt in the Strand, where they may be seen at work, there are
thirty such elements, each weighing about 50 lbs. It takes a two-horse-power
engine working an Edison or Gramme machine six to eight hours to charge
them, and when charged they will keep almost any number of lamps of
sixteen-candle-power going some eight hours. They are used on the
Brighton and South Coast Railway, and seem peculiarly adapted to lighting
by incandescence, by Swan, or Edison’s lamp. The elements fully charged
may be carried any distance without losing their electric power. And the
stored force may be used for charging the accumulators themselves afresh
from the machine. These accumulators may be seen any day at 446, Strand,
and are well worth a visit.</p>

<p>The Gyroscope, though now an instrument common and familiar to all
students, is none the less the subject of a problem, the solution of which
is still to seek. It has indeed been entitled the paradox of mechanics; for
though it depends on gravitation, gravitation yet appears indifferent to it.
In order to render the operation of the Gyroscope as continuous as possible,
so as to facilitate the profound study of its working, and also to unite
another influence with those of the ordinary Gyroscope, producing phenomena
of which this instrument affords us the spectacle, a learned American
has employed electricity as a motive power.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_278.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 277.—The Gyroscope.</div>
</div>

<p>The Gyroscope, shown in fig. 277, has a large, heavy pedestal, with a
pointed column, which supports the instrument itself. The frame, of which the
electro-magnets form a part, is connected with a rod, having at one end a hollow
cavity which rests on the point of the vertical column. One of the extremities
of the magnetic spool is attached to this cavity, the other end communicating
with the bar which unites the two magnets. Over this bar is a spring which
breaks the current, supported by an insulator in hard india-rubber; it is adjusted
so that it touches a small cylinder on the axis of the wheel twice during every
rotation of the latter. The wheel’s plane of rotation is at right angles with the
magnets, and it carries an armature of soft iron, which rotates close to the
magnet without touching it. The armature is so placed in relation to the
surface of contact with the cylinder that breaks the current, that twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
during each rotation, as the armature approaches the magnets, it is attracted;
but immediately afterwards, as the armature comes directly in front of the
magnets, the current is broken, and the acquired impulsion is sufficient to
move the wheel until the armature comes again under the influence of the
magnet. The spring which interrupts the current is connected with a thin
copper wire, which stretches back as far as the point of the column,
entwining it several times to render it flexible, finally bending down and
plunging into some mercury enclosed in a round vulcanite cup placed on
the column near the pedestal. The pedestal also bears two small stakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
for receiving the wires of the battery, one connected with the column, and
the other communicating by a small wire with the mercury contained in
the vulcanite vessel. The magnets, the wheel, and all the connected parts
can move in any direction round the point of the column. When two
large Bunsen cells, or four small ones, are connected with the Gyroscope, the
wheel turns with great rapidity, and allowing the magnets to operate, it
not only sustains itself, but also the magnets and the other objects which
are between it and the point of the column in opposition to the laws of
gravitation. The wheel, besides turning rapidly round its axis, also effects a
slow rotation round the column in the direction of the movement experienced
by the <em>lower part</em> of the wheel. By placing the arm and the counterpoise of
the machine as shown in fig. 277, so that the wheel and the magnets balance
exactly on the pointed column, the whole machine rests stationary; but if
we give the preponderance to the wheel and the magnets, the apparatus
begins to rotate in a direction contrary to or following that of the <em>upper part</em>
of the wheel.</p>

<p>The Gyroscope exemplifies very clearly the persistence with which a
body undergoing a movement of rotation maintains itself in the plane of its
rotation in spite of gravitation. It shows also the result of the combined
action of two forces tending to produce rotations round two axes which are
separate, but situated in the same plane. The rotation of the wheel round
its axis, produced, in the present instance, by the electro-magnet, and the
tendency of the wheel to fall or turn in a vertical plane, parallel to its axis,
produce, as a result, the rotation of the entire instrument round a new axis
which coincides with the column.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Peiffer’s Electrophorus.</span></p>

<p>It will now perhaps interest our readers to describe a charming little
plaything which is a great favourite with children, and which has the incontestable
merit of early initiating them into all the principal phenomena of
the statics of electricity, and teaching them the science of physics in an
amusing form.</p>

<p>It is a small electrophorus invented by M. J. Peiffer, and reduced to
such a point of simplicity, that it consists merely of a thin plate of ebonite,
about the size of a large sheet of letter paper. The tinned wooden disc of
the electrophorus which is found described in most treatises on physics, is
replaced by a small sheet of tin, about the size of a playing-card, fastened
on to the surface of the ebonite. The ebonite electrophorus produces
electricity with remarkable facility. It must be placed flat on a wooden
table, and thoroughly rubbed with the hand; if it is then lifted, and the
sheet of tin lightly touched, a spark is elicited from &frac14; inch to &frac12; inch in
length. The electrophorus is completed by the addition of a number of
small accessories in the shape of small dolls made of elder-wood, which
exhibit in a very amusing manner the phenomena of attraction and repulsion.
After the board has been charged with electricity, place the three little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
figures on the sheet of tin, and lift up the apparatus, so as to isolate it from
any support. You will then see one little doll extending its arms, another with
its silky hair standing on end, and a third, lighter than the others, leaping
like a clown, and displacing as he does so the two small balls of elder-wood
which have been placed on each side of him. We have given an illustration
of the three figures performing at once (fig. 278), but they are generally used
separately. M. Peiffer has indeed collected every known accessory for an
electric machine, such as Geissler’s tube, the electric carillon, etc. These
different experiments are all reduced to their simplest form, and, with their
appliances, are all contained in a cardboard box. They are placed beside
the electrophorus, which thus takes the place of an unwieldy electric
machine. M. J. Peiffer accompanies this little portable cabinet with an
exhaustive pamphlet, which is a valuable guide to the young physicist in
studying the first principles of electricity.</p>

<p>“It is easy to discover in the education of children,” says M. Peiffer
in his preface, “how to turn their budding faculties to the best account.
Would you utilize them in a satisfactory manner?—Then put in their
hands playthings which, in an attractive form, serve to familiarize them at
an early age with those sciences, a knowledge of which will be at a later
period absolutely indispensable to them; and they will be much more
amused than with ordinary commonplace toys.”</p>

<p>These are sensible words, in which we heartily concur. Yes! Science
properly taught, and properly understood, can indeed be brought within
the range of children; it should give a lasting interest to all amusements,
and form a part of the culture of the youthful mind, as at a later period
it will contribute to the perfect development of the grown man.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Magic Fish.</span></p>

<p>An ingenious physicist, M. de. Combettes, who is a civil engineer at Paris,
has devoted himself to constructing a number of playthings and scientific
appliances for young people, among which we will describe the very curious
one represented in fig. 279. A jar is filled with water, holding in suspension
some fish made of tin, similar to those which children put in water
and attract with a magnet. In this case, however, the mechanism is hidden,
and the operator can turn the fish first in one direction and then in the
other at pleasure. The secret of this experiment is easily explained by
examining the illustration (fig. 279). In the wooden stand which supports
the jar there is concealed a small electro-magnet which acts on the soft
iron contained in the floating fish. When the current passes the small
magnet turns round and attracts the little fish swimming in the water.
This gyratory movement can be changed at pleasure by means of a regulator.</p>

<img src="images/i_281b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 280.—An electric toy.</div>
</div>

<p>We will give an illustration of a few electric toys which M. Trouvé
has found for us. In the picture (fig. 281) we see three different objects,—a
rabbit beating a small bell, a representation of a bird with outstretched
wings, and a pin surmounted by a skull. All these are capable of having
movement imparted to them by means of electricity, although made and
intended for ordinary use in the form of scarf-pin or other ornament.</p>

<p>Let us take the “death’s head” pin first. It is in gold, and enamelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
with diamond eyes and articulated jaws. The rabbit is also gold, and
carries two small drumsticks, with which he can play a tiny bell. This
device also can be worn as a scarf-pin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_282.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> Fig. 281.—Magic toys.</div>
</div>

<p>A conducting wire leads from the pin into the waistcoat pocket, where
a small “pile,” about the size of a cigarette, is hidden away. If any one
particularly admires the scarf-pin, all you have to do is to insinuate your
fingers into your pocket, and you will, by contact, cause the electric current
to act upon the pin in your scarf. The death’s head will at once begin to
roll its eyes and grind its teeth, while the rabbit, under similar circumstances,
will begin to play its bell with the greatest energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>The handsome diamond bird represented in the centre of the illustration
belongs to Madame de Metternich. When any lady wears it in her hair,
she can, by the concealed wire, make it flap its jewelled wings, and by so
doing cause much surprise amongst the spectators.</p>

<p>We will now endeavour to give a description of the manner in which
these toys play their parts in company with the “hermetic-pile” which
M. Trouvé has applied to many specialities that he has supplied to doctors,
who use them largely.</p>

<p>This pile is formed by a “couple” of carbon and zinc hermetically
enclosed in an ebonite box. The carbon and zinc only occupy one-half
of the case. The liquid occupies the other. The sketch (fig. 280) on
preceding page will explain the apparatus.</p>

<p>So long as the case is in its normal position the elements are not
immersed in the solution, and consequently no electricity is developed.
But as soon as the figure is placed in a horizontal or leaning position the
force is generated; on readjusting the box the electric current is cut off,
and all development ceases. Many curious electrical toys can be seen in
Paris. Dolls are made to talk, and many other wonders for children can
be easily procured.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Animal and Atmospheric Electricity.</span></p>

<p>Before concluding the subject of electricity we must devote a few pages
to the consideration of the electric influence possessed by certain fishes, and
to some of the phenomena of the atmosphere, especially thunderstorms.
We have seen how Galvani experimented upon the limbs of frogs, and
maintained that they possessed electricity; he attributed the current in the
muscles to that cause. This theory Volta denied, but subsequently Nobili,
in 1827, proved the existence of a current in the frog by means of a Galvanometer.
This was conclusive, and the experiment was performed in the
following manner:—He filled two vessels with salt and water, and into one
he dipped the crucal muscles of a frog, and in the other the lumbar nerves
were immersed. By putting these vessels in communication with his improved
Galvanometer, which was extremely sensitive, he perceived a current
passing from the feet towards the head of the animal.</p>

<p>It is, however, to Matteucci and Du Bois Reymond that the investigation
of the phenomena of the <i lang="fr">courant propre</i> are due. The former formed a
“pile” of the thighs of frogs, and by placing the interior and exterior muscles
in contact he formed a current from the inside to the outside muscles. This
current is supposed to be occasioned by certain chemical changes which
are continually taking place, and it continues longer in the case of a cold-blooded
animal than in a warm-blooded one. There are many interesting
papers on this subject included amongst the “Philosophical Transactions”;
and the “Physical Phenomena of Living Beings” is fully treated in Matteucci’s
lectures on that subject. In the “Transactions” for 1848 and subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
years, other experiments may be perused, but space will not permit us to
dilate upon them. The fact has been established, and we are told that
muscles and nerves, as well as certain glands of the body, possess certain
electrical properties.</p>

<p>The electricity of fishes, and the power possessed by the torpedo—whose
name is now chiefly known in connection with warlike appliances—and the
gymnotus, have been known for a very long time. This fish, popularly
known as the electric eel, inhabits the warm fresh-water lakes of Africa,
Asia, and America. A specimen was exhibited
at the Polytechnic some years ago.
This was the fish experimented on at the
Adelaide Gallery by Professor Faraday, who
clearly demonstrated the fact that the electricity
of the animal and the common electricity
are identical. Numerous experiments were
made, and the circuit shock and even sparks
were obtained from the gymnotus. In fact,
the gymnotus is a natural electric machine.
The force of the shock given by the electric
eel is very great, for Faraday has put on
record that a single discharge of the eel is
equal to fifteen Leyden jars charged as highly
as possible. Its power does not even end there, for having shocked people
to that extent, it was capable of a second and occasionally of a third shock
of less violence.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_284a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 282.—Electric eel.</div>
</div>

<p>The manner in which the gymnotus acts is from a regular battery in
the head, the sides of which are filled with a fluid. These cells are something
like a honeycomb in appearance. The
shock is quite voluntary on the part of the fish.
Sometimes it will kill its prey, on other occasions
it is merely numbed. Professor Faraday on one
occasion placed a live fish in the tub with the
gymnotus, which curled itself so as to enclose
the unsuspecting one. In a second the prey
was struck dead, and floated on the water. The
gymnotus immediately devoured it, and went in
quest of more. Another, but an injured fish,
was then introduced, but the electric eel took no
trouble about this one. It did not trouble to
give it a shock, seeing it was disabled, it merely swallowed without killing it.
It is also on record that on one occasion an electric eel had stunned a fish
which, before he began to eat it, gave signs of returning animation; the eel
immediately gave it another shock and killed it.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_284b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 283.—Large gymnotus.</div>
</div>

<p>There were some other curious peculiarities connected with the electric
eel. It appears to be quite capable of discriminating between animate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
inanimate touch. For instance, when touched with a glass rod it at first
gave signs of electricity, and discharged a shock at the attacking party. But
on subsequent occasions, when touched with metal rods or glass, the fish
declined to “shock”; nevertheless the Professor succeeded the moment he
touched the animal with his hands.</p>

<p>The torpedo is something like the well-known skate; it is sometimes
called the electric ray, and is common
enough in the Bay of Biscay and in the
Mediterranean Sea. It sometimes pays
England a visit, or is caught by fishermen
and brought in. We have seen one at
Plymouth, and a very ugly-looking fish it
was. Its electric power is considerable.</p>

</div>

<p>There is yet another fish known as
the malapterurus; one species is called
the thunder-fish. Professor Wilson has
written a paper upon the electric fishes as
applied to the remedy of disease, and
considers them the “earliest electric machines
ever known.”</p>

<p>Humboldt relates that the South-American
Indians capture the gymnotus
by driving horses into ponds which the
electric eels are known to inhabit. The
result is that the fish deliver shock after
shock upon the unfortunate quadrupeds.
Mules and horses have frequently been
killed by these powerful eels, and even
Faraday experienced a very great shock
when he touched the head and tail of the
captive gymnotus with either hand.</p>

<p>The malapterurus to which we have referred is an inhabitant of the
African rivers, chiefly in the Nile and Senegal. Such a fish has been known
with others for some hundreds of years; its electrical powers are not great.
There are one or two other species
of fish which possess electrical
qualities, but none apparently to
the same extent as the torpedo
and the gymnotus.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 285.—The Malapterurus.</div>
</div>
<p>The electricity of plants also
is in some cases very marked.
Flashes have been seen to come from some flowers in hot and dry weather.
Currents of electricity have been detected, and Wartmann investigated the
subject closely. He says the currents in flowers are feeble, but in succulent
fruits and some kinds of grain they are very marked. These currents depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
upon the season, and are greatest in the spring, when the plant is bathed
in sap. These experiences were confirmed by Bequerel in 1850, and he
concludes that the rank vegetation in some parts of the world must exercise
considerable influence on the electric phenomena of the atmosphere. M.
Buff has more recently made experiments in this direction, and he examined
plants and trees, and even mushrooms. M. de la Rive, after carefully
summing up the various theories, comes to the conclusion that it is to
chemical reactions that the traces of electricity are due.</p>

<p>The subject of atmospherical electricity properly belongs to meteorology,
and under that heading we will treat of it more fully. But lightning is so
identified with electricity, and being the most common form observable to
all, we will say something about thunderstorms and the electric discharges
accompanying them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_286.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 286.—Benjamin Franklin.</div>
</div>

<p>Before Franklin’s ever-memorable experiment with his kite established
the identity of lightning and electricity, the resemblance between the two
discharges had been frequently noticed. The Etruscans pretended to bring
down lightning from heaven, and Tullus Hostilius, when experimenting or
performing certain “ceremonies,” was killed by the electric discharge he
desired to attract. But after all, we cannot attribute any knowledge of
electric science to the ancients, although they were, of course, familiar with
electric phenomena.</p>

<p>It is to Dr. Wall that testimony points as the first person who
remarked the analogy between the electric spark and lightning. This was
in 1708. Grey and other philosophers supported the theory, but could not
establish it. To Franklin, who in June 1752 actually brought down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
lightning by his kite and a key, is the actual discovery due. We have
already detailed the circumstances (page 206) and need not repeat the
account of the experiment.</p>

<p>Of course the American philosopher found numerous imitators, not
always with impunity. Professor Richmann was killed by the spirit he was
invoking; Lemounier and Beccaria confirmed the theory that the air was
full of electricity; while Du Saussure, from his investigations on the Alps,
and Volta from the invention of the pile, are most famous in the history
of electricity. They applied themselves with much success to the investigation
of the electric condition of the atmosphere, of which the disturbances
called thunderstorms are the result.</p>

<p>The amount of electricity varies in the atmosphere at different times
in the day and night. Towards midday and midnight the development is
generally greatest, and this fact will account for the prevalence of storms
during our hours of rest. Again, different kinds of clouds have different
degrees of electricity, and of different kinds. Under certain conditions these
clouds will give forth lightning, and a storm will begin. The more clouds
the more globules, and therefore in summer, while there is more production
of vapour from solutions of salts, etc., we are more likely to have the storms.
We are most of us familiar with the mass of the “thunder cloud” rising in
the distance, light at the upper part, very dark below, and throwing out
tentacles like the octopus, coming up sometimes—frequently, indeed—“against
the wind,” impelled by an upper current, or following the course
of a river, which is not unusual. Below, there is perhaps an army of thin
dark clouds. The nature and height of clouds have also a great deal to do
with the phenomena displayed. In general, storm-clouds are positively
electrified.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_287.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 287.—Cirrus cloud.</div>
</div>

<p>Clouds are good conductors of electricity, and yet they may be so
insulated by the dry air surrounding them that they will accumulate it; and
when thus charged, if they encounter other clouds charged with opposite
electricity, the opposing masses will attract each other until a discharge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
takes place. This is what we term lightning, and under such conditions
electricity, though very dazzling, is harmless. It is when the cloud comes
near to the earth, and a discharge is released, that lightning is so dangerous
to persons who remain in the fields. Sometimes the discharge comes from
the earth to meet that from the cloud. Sheep are frequently killed by
ground lightning, and once, at Malvern, we had an escape from an upward
stroke. The back-stroke from a cloud is also dangerous. It may happen
that the cloud has discharged itself upon the earth many miles away, but a
return discharge takes place at the other end, and if that end be near the
earth the consequences may be serious. As a rule, the return stroke is not
so violent as the first discharge.</p>

<p>The colour of lightning varies very much. We have the white, the
blue, the violet, and red. The colour depends upon the distance and
intensity of the lightning, and the more there is of it the whiter the light.
We can illustrate the varied hues of the electric “fluid” by passing a spark
through the receiver of an air-pump. If the air be rarefied, or there be a
vacuum, we shall perceive a blue or violet light. Therefore we may conclude
that the blue and violet flashes have birth in high strata of the atmosphere.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_288.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 288.—Cumulus cloud.</div>
</div>

<p>We have all heard how dangerous it is to stand under a tree during
a thunderstorm, or rather, we should say, when the storm is approaching us
nearly. The tree is a conductor, and the lightning having no better one at
hand will pass through the tree on its way to the earth, and if we are standing
against the tree we shall be included in the course, and die from the shock to
the nerves while the lightning is passing through us. The best position in a
thunderstorm, if we are in the neighbourhood of trees, is to sit or lie down
on the ground some little distance from the base of the nearest tree. If the
tree be sixty feet high suppose, and we sit fifty feet or less from the trunk,
we shall be pretty safe, because the lightning will reach the tree top before
it can reach us. We are protected by it as by a conductor, bad though it
be. Standing up in a boat during a storm is not wise. Lightning has an
affinity for water, and besides, if no higher objects are near, our body will act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
as a conductor. Bed is the safest place, as blankets are non-conductors.
Cellars are not the safest by any means. Lightning may, and it frequently
does, strike the house and descend to the basement. If the air be very full
of electricity, and a flash be near, a
person running away may conduct
the lightning to himself by creating a
vacuum into which the flash may
dart.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_289.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 289.—Nimbus, or rain cloud.</div>
</div>

<p>Arago classified lightning into
three kinds: zig-zag, globular, and
sheet. The first we call forked
lightning, and frequently this kind
branches out at the end, so that
although there may be only one flash,
it may strike out in two or three
directions at the same time. This
may be accounted for by the unequal
power of the air strata to conduct the
electricity. The forked flashes are
of very great length, extending frequently
for miles, and the bifurcations
also are often miles apart. The duration
of the flash is less than the
thousandth part of a second; so
instantaneous is it that no motion
can be perceived even in a most
rapidly-moving wheel, as proved by Professor Wheatstone. We sometimes
fancy that the flash lasts longer, but the impression received by the eye
quite accounts for the apparently prolonged sight of the lightning.</p>

<p>Sheet lightning, the faint flashes frequently seen upon the horizon,
are quite harmless. Sheet lightning is that which is seen reflected behind
clouds or from far-distant storms. It is sometimes very beautiful. Ball,
or globular lightning, is dangerous, and globes of fire have been seen to
descend, and striking the ground, bound onwards for some distance. The
descent of these forms of electric discharge has given rise to the popular
notion of “thunderbolts.” The “Mariner’s Lights,” or St. Elmo’s fire, is
frequently observed in ships. It is usually regarded as a fortunate occurrence.
It was noticed by Columbus. One voyager describes the phenomena as
follows:—“The sky was suddenly covered with thick clouds.... There were
more than thirty of St. Elmo’s fires on the ship. One of them occupied
the vane of the mainmast. I sent a sailor to fetch it. When he was aloft
he heard a noise like that which is made when moist gunpowder is burned.
I ordered him to take off the vane. He had scarcely executed this order,
when the fire quitted it and placed itself at the apex of the mainmast,
whence it could not possibly be removed.”</p>

<p>There have been occasions when the manes and tails of horses, and
even the ears of human beings, have shown a phosphorescent light which
emitted a hissing noise. Alpine travellers have noticed similar phenomena;
and Professor Forbes, when crossing the Theodule Pass into Italy, heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
the hissing sound in his alpenstock. The tips of rocks and grass points
were all hissing too. The party were in the midst of an electric cloud.
When the Professor turned the point of his alpenstock upwards, a vivid
flash was emitted, but no thunder followed. They descended as quickly
as possible from such a dangerous neighbourhood.</p>

</div>

<p>It is observable that the properties of lightning and of the electric
spark are identical—the faint crackle of the latter being magnified into
the loud rolling of the thunder. The disturbance of the atmosphere is the
cause of the loud reverberations, and echoes produced from clouds tend to
intensify and prolong the peal. The sound rises and falls, and varies
accordingly as the cloud is near or far. A smart sharp report or rattle
denotes the nearness of the lightning, while the gradual swelling and
subsidence, followed, mayhap, by an increasing volume of sound, which in
its turn dies away, tells us that the danger is not imminent. The cause o£
this loud rolling, unless it proceeds from echoes from different clouds, has
not been satisfactorily explained. Sound travels less quickly than light,
and therefore we only hear the thunder some seconds after we have
perceived the flash. It is therefore conceivable that we may hear the last
reverberations and its echoes first, and the sound of the first disturbance
with its echoes last of all. Thus there will be distinct sounds. Firstly,
the actual noise we call thunder from the air strata <em>nearest</em> to us; secondly,
the echoes of that disturbance from the clouds, of course fainter; then we
hear the sound caused by the tearing asunder of the air particles farthest
off, and again the echoes of that disturbance. This theory will, we think,
account for the swelling peals of thunder, and the successive loud and
fainter reverberations. At any rate, in the absence of any other theory, we
submit it for consideration. The sound of thunder is seldom or never
heard at a distance greater than fifteen miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>Lightning conductors are such every-day objects that no description is
necessary; but the reason the lightning runs along it harmlessly is because
the galvanized iron rod is the best conductor in the immediate neighbourhood.
Where there is not a good conductor lightning will accept the next
best, and so on, any conductor being better than none. The point of the
rod cannot contain any electricity, there being no room for it, and the
“fluid,” as it is termed, runs down to the ground, to terminate, when
possible, in water or charcoal. A great deal of electricity is no doubt
carried away from the air by the numerous conductors without any spark
passing. Until Sir W. Snow Harris brought forward his lightning conductors
for ships, the loss was great at sea. But now we rarely hear of
any vessel being disabled by lightning. We owe to Franklin the idea of
the lightning conductor.</p>

<p>According to observations made by Mr. Crosse, the following statement
shows the tendency of the atmosphere, in certain conditions, to thunderstorms.
We may accept the deduction of M. Peltier that grey and slate-colour
clouds are charged with negative, and white, rose-colour, and orange
clouds with positive electricity. The order of arrangement in the following
table places the most likely source of thunderstorms first, and the least
likely source at the end, with regular rotation of intermediate probabilities
intervening:—</p>


<ol class="table"><li> Regular thunder clouds.</li>
<li>Driving fog with small rain.</li>
<li>Fall of snow, or hailstorm.</li>
<li>Smart shower on a hot day.</li>
<li>Smart shower on a cold day.</li>
<li>Hot weather after wet days.</li>
<li>Wet weather after dry days.</li>
<li>Clear frosty weather.</li>
<li>Clear warm weather.</li>
<li>Cloudy days.</li>
<li>“Mackerel” sky.</li>
<li>Sultry weather and hazy clouds.</li>
<li>Cold damp night.</li>
<li>Cold, dry north-east winds.</li></ol>


<p>We have thus briefly touched upon some of the atmospherical phenomena
directly attributable to electricity. In our articles upon Meteorology we
will consider the aurora and many other interesting facts concerning the
atmosphere, and the effects of sound, heat, and light upon the air.</p>

<p class="hang">PRESSURE OF AIR IN BODIES—EARLY ATTEMPTS TO FLY IN THE AIR—DISCOVERY
OF HYDROGEN—THE MONTGOLFIER BALLOONS—FIRST
EXPERIMENTS IN PARIS—NOTED ASCENTS.</p>


<p>In the first part of this volume we entered into the circumstances of air
pressure, and in the Chemistry section we shall be told about the atmosphere
and its constituents. We know that the air around us is composed principally
of two gases, oxygen and nitrogen, with aqueous vapour and some
carbonic acid. An enormous quantity of carbonic acid is produced every
day, and were it not for the action of vegetation the amount produced
would speedily set all animal life at rest. But our friends, the plants, decompose
the carbonic acid by assimilating the carbon and setting free the
oxygen which animals consume. Thus our atmosphere keeps its balance, so
to speak. Nothing is lost in nature.</p>

<p>We have illustrated the pressure of the atmosphere by the Magdeburg
hemispheres, and we know that the higher we ascend the pressure is
lessened. The weight of the atmosphere is 15 lbs. to the square inch at
sea level. This we have seen in the barometer. Now pressure is equal.
Any body immersed in a liquid suffers pressure, and we remember
Archimedes and the crown. It displaced a certain amount of water when
immersed. A body in air displaces it just the same. Therefore when any
body is heavier than the air, it will fall just as a stone will fall in water.
If it be of equal weight, it will remain balanced in the air, if lighter it will
rise, till it attains a height where the weight of the atmosphere and its own
are equal; there it will remain till the conditions are altered. Now we will
readily understand why balloons float in the air, and why clouds ascend and
descend in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>In the following pages we propose to consider the question of ballooning,
and the possibility of flying. We all have been anxious concerning the
unfortunate balloonist who was lost in the Channel, so some details concerning
the science generally, with the experiences of skilled aeronauts, will guide
us in our selection of material. We will first give a history of the efforts
made by the ancients to fly, and this ambition to soar above the earth has
not yet died out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>From a very early period man appears to have been desirous to study
the art of flying. The old myths of Dædalus and Icarus show us this, and
it is not to be wondered at. When the graceful flight of birds is noticed, we
feel envious almost that we cannot rise from the earth and sail away at our
pleasure over land and sea. Any one who has watched the flight of the
storks around and above Strasburg will feel desirous to emulate that long,
swift-sailing flight without apparent motion of wing, and envy the accuracy
with which the bird hits the point aimed at on the chimney, however small.
It is small wonder that some heathens of old time looked upon birds as
deities.</p>

<p>The earliest flying machine that we can trace is that invented by
Archytas, of Tarentum, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 400. The historian of the “Brazen Age” tells
us how the geometrician, Archytas, made a wooden pigeon which was able
to sustain itself in the air for a few minutes, but it came down to the ground
after a short time, notwithstanding the mysterious “aura spirit” with which
it was supposed to be endowed. The capability of flying has for centuries
been regarded as supernatural. Putting angels aside, demons are depicted
with wings like bats’ wings, while witches, etc., possessed the faculty of flying
up chimneys upon broomsticks. We even read in childish lore of an old
woman who “went up in a basket” (perhaps a balloon-car), and attained a
most astonishing altitude-an elevation no less than “seventy times as high
as the moon!”</p>

<p>But to descend to history. It is undoubtedly true that in the time of
Nero, Simon Magus attempted to fly from one house to another by means
of some mechanical contrivance, and failing, killed himself. Roger Bacon,
the “admirable doctor,” to whom the invention of gunpowder is generally
attributed, had distinct notions of flying by means of machines, and “hollow
globes,” and “liquid fire.” But he did not succeed, nor did many successive
attempts succeed any better in subsequent years. Bishop Wilkins treated of
the art of flying, but most, if not all who discussed the subject appear to
have been indebted to Roger Bacon for the idea.</p>

<p>When the nature and pressure of the atmosphere by Torricelli’s
experiments became better known, Father Lana, a Jesuit priest, constructed
a flying machine or balloon of curious shape. He proposed to
fix four copper globes, very thin, and about twenty feet in diameter, and to
these he fastened a boat or car, looking very much like a basin. His idea
was to empty his great copper globes, and that their buoyancy would then
bear the weight of the traveller. But he overlooked or was ignorant of the
effect of the atmospheric pressure, which would have speedily crushed the
thin copper globes when empty. Lana’s suggestion was made in 1670, the
barometer had been discovered in 1643.</p>

<p>There were some fairly successful experiments made in flying in 1678
and in 1709. The former attempt was made by Besmir, a locksmith of
Sable, who raised himself by means of wings up to the top of a house by
leaps, and then succeeded in passing from one house to another lower down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
by supporting himself in the air for a time. He started from an elevated position,
and came down by degrees. Dante, a mathematician, also tried to fly, but
without great success. He broke his thigh on one occasion. Laurence de
Gusman claimed an invention for flying in 1709, and petitioned for a “patent,”
which was granted by the king’s letter. The machine appears to have
borne some resemblance to a bird.</p>

<p>It was not till 1782, however, that the true art of aerial navigation was
discovered. The knowledge of hydrogen gas possessed by Cavendish in
1766 no doubt led up to it, and in the year following its discovery
Professor Black, lecturing in Edinburgh, stated that it was much lighter
than the atmosphere, and that any vessel filled with the gas would rise in
the air. We now come to the invention of the <span class="smcap">Balloon</span> (so called from its
shape being similar to a vessel used in the laboratory) by the Brothers
Montgolfier.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_295.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 293.—Montgolfier balloon.</div>
</div>

<p>Stephen and James Montgolfier were paper-makers, and carried on
their business at Annonay, near Lyons, but it was partly by accident that the
great discovery was made. They had no knowledge of the buoyancy of
hydrogen gas. They took their idea of the balloon (inflated) from noticing
an ascending column of smoke. It occurred to Stephen that if a paper bag
were filled with smoke it would ascend into the air. A large bag was made
and some paper burnt beneath it in a room. When the smoke had filled
the bag it was released, and immediately ascended to the ceiling. Here was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
the germ of the Montgolfier or heated air balloon. The experiment was
repeated in the open air with even greater success, and a trial upon a larger
scale was immediately determined upon. A story is related of Mongolfier
when prosecuting his researches, that a widow whose husband had belonged
to the printing firm with whom Montgolfier was then connected in business,
saw the smoke issuing from the room in which the little balloon was being
filled. She entered, and was astonished to see the difficulty experienced by
the experimenter in filling the balloon. It swerved aside, and increased the
trouble he had to keep it above the chafing dish. Montgolfier was greatly
troubled, and seeing his disappointment, the widow said, “Why don’t you
fasten the balloon to the chafing dish?” This had not occurred to the
experimenter, and the idea was a valuable one. That was the secret of
success.</p>

<p>The Montgolfier Brothers determined to exhibit their successful experiment,
and accordingly on the 5th of June, 1783, a great concourse assembled
to see the wonderful sight. A large canvas or linen balloon was made and
suspended over a fire of chopped straw. The heated air quickly filled the
balloon, which rose high in the air, and descended more than a mile away.
This balloon contained 22,000 cubic feet of heated air, which is lighter than
cold air, and of course rising carried the globe with it. As soon as the air
began to cool the balloon ceased to rise, and as it got colder descended.</p>

<p>Here was the actual discovery of the science of Aerostatics. The intelligence
of the success achieved soon spread from France to other countries.
Paris, however, was in advance, and the Brothers Robert applied hydrogen
gas to a balloon which was sent up from the Champ de Mars in August
1783. There was some trouble experienced in filling it, but when the balloon
was at length released it realized all expectations by remaining in the air
nearly an hour. When at length it fell it met with a worse fate than it
deserved, for the ignorant and superstitious peasantry at once destroyed it.
After this Montgolfier exhibited his experiment next time at Versailles in the
presence of the Court. The first aerial travellers appeared on this occasion—viz.,
a sheep, a cock, and a duck, which were secured in the car. They all
descended in safety, and this success encouraged M. Pilatre de Rozier to
make an attempt in a “fire balloon.” He went up first in a captive balloon,
and at length he and a friend, the Marquis d’Arlandes, ascended from the
Bois de Boulogne. The trip was a decided success, and the possibility of
navigating the air was fully demonstrated.</p>

<p>Soon after this,—viz., in December 1783,—an Italian Count, named
Zambeccari, made an ascent in London, and came down safely at Petworth.
MM. Charles and Robert ascended from Paris in December, and in February
a balloon crossed the English Channel. We must pass over some time and
come to the ascents of Lunardi, which caused great excitement in London.
His balloon was a very large one, and was inflated, or rather partially so, at
the Artillery ground. Some delay occurred, and fearing a riot, M. Lunardi
proposed to go up alone with the partially-filled balloon. A Mr. Biggin who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
had intended to ascend was left behind. The Prince of Wales was present,
with thousands of spectators. Lunardi cast off and ascended rapidly, causing
great admiration from the whole metropolis. Judge and jury, sovereign and
ministers, all turned out to gaze at the balloon; a guilty prisoner was acquitted
hurriedly, so that no time was lost in discussion, and one lady died
of excitement. Lunardi was regarded as a hero, and made many other
ascents. He died in 1806.</p>

<p>In those earlier days one or two fatal accidents happened. Count
Zambeccari and a companion were in a balloon which caught fire, and both
occupants of the car leaped from it as they were descending. The Count was
killed on the spot, and his companion was much injured. Pilatre de Rozier
made an attempt to cross the channel to England in 1785; he had reached
three thousand feet when the balloon caught fire, and the unfortunate traveller
was precipitated to the ground. His associate only survived him a few minutes.</p>

<p>It is to the celebrated English aeronaut, Mr. Green, that the substitution
of carburetted hydrogen or street gas for hydrogen is due, and since his ascent
in 1821 no other means of inflation have been used. A great many quite
successful and a few unsuccessful ascents have been made for pleasure or
profit. Mr. Green, in the <em>Nassau</em> balloon, passed over to Nassau, a distance of
five hundred miles, in eighteen hours. This exploit was the cause of the name
being bestowed upon the balloon. The <em>Giant</em> of M. Nadar was exhibited in
England, and it was an enormous one, being an hundred feet high, and
nearly as wide in the widest part. But even this machine was outdone by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
the Godard “Montgolfier” balloon, which was one hundred and seventeen
feet high, and carried a stove. We give illustrations of these celebrated
balloons, and will now pass on to the more scientific portion of the subject
and the ascents of Mr. Glaisher and other aeronauts for the purpose of
making meteorological observations, and the use of balloons for purposes of
observation in war.</p>

<p>It appears that the first ascent for scientific investigation was made in
the year 1803. The aeronauts were Messrs. Robertson and Lhoest. They
ascended from Hamburg and came down at Hanover, and made meantime
several experiments with reference to the electrical condition of the atmosphere,
its influence upon a magnetic needle, and some experiments with
regard to acoustics and heat. The report was presented to the St. Petersburg
Academy, and contains the result of their interesting observations. The
travellers ascertained that at the elevation to which they attained,—viz.,
25,500 feet,—the temperature was on that July day fifty degrees colder,
falling to 19·6°, while on the earth the thermometer had shown 68°. They
ascertained that glass and wax did not become electric when rubbed, that
the Voltaic battery lost much of its power, that the oscillation of a “dipping
needle” increased as they mounted into the air, while sound was certainly
less easily transmitted at that elevation, and struck them as less powerful in
tone. The heat experiment was not a success, owing to the breaking of the
thermometer. They wished to find the temperature of boiling water at that
elevation, but when the experiment was about to be made Robertson accidentally
plunged the instrument <em>into the fire</em> instead of into the water. So
the question was not settled.</p>

<p>The effect upon the aeronauts was a sensation of sleepiness, and two
birds died. The muscular powers of the voyagers also appear to have been
much affected, and similar sensations may be experienced by travellers on
high mountains who find their breath very short and a disinclination to
exertion oppress them.</p>

<p>MM. Biot and Gay-Lussac made a very interesting ascent in 1804.
We will detail their experiences at some length, for the coolness displayed
and the value of the observations made are remarkable in the history of
scientific ballooning. They started, at 10 o’clock a.m. on the 23rd of
August, and when the balloon had carried them up to an altitude of 8,600
feet they commenced their experiments. They had some animals in the
car with them, a bee amongst the number, and the insect was let go first.
It flew away swiftly, not at all inconvenienced apparently. The sun was
very hot at 56° Fahr. Their pulses were beating very fast, but no inconvenience
was felt.</p>

<p>When 11,000 feet had been reached a linnet was permitted to go at
large, but after a little time the bird returned to the balloon. It remained
perched for a few minutes, and then dashed downwards at a tremendous
pace. A pigeon was then liberated. It also appeared very uncertain, and
wheeled around in circles for a time. At last it gained confidence, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
descended, and disappeared in the clouds beneath. They made other
experiments, but descended without having obtained as accurate results as
had been anticipated.</p>

<p>On the next occasion, however, every care was taken, and on
the 15th of September the important ascent was made by Gay-Lussac
alone. He fixed hanging ropes to the balloon with the view to
check the rotating movements, and having provided himself with all
necessary apparatus and two vacuum flasks to bring down some of the
upper air, the young man started. The barometer marked 30·66°, the
thermometer 82° (Fahr.). At an elevation of 12,680 feet Lussac perceived
that the variation of the compass was the same as on land. Two hundred
feet higher up he ascertained that a key held in the magnetic direction
repelled with the lower, and attracted with its upper extremity the north
pole of a needle. This experiment was repeated with the same result at an
elevation of 20,000 feet, which shows how the earth exercises its magnetic
influence. The temperature of the air was found to decrease in proportion
as the ascent up to 12,000 feet, where the reading was 47·3". It then
increased up to 14,000 feet by 6°, and then regularly diminished again
as the balloon rose, till at the greatest elevation reached, 23,000 feet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
there was a difference of 67° in the temperature on the earth, for at
the maximum height attained the thermometer stood at 14·9°.</p>

<p>But the most important fact ascertained, and one which set many
theories at rest, was the composition of the atmosphere in those high
altitudes. We mentioned that Gay-Lussac took up two empty flasks from
which the air had been taken. The vacuum was almost perfect. When
the aeronaut had reached 21,460 feet he opened one flask, and it was
quickly filled; he secured it carefully; and when at his highest point,—four
miles and a half above the sea-level,—he opened the other flask. The
barometer stood at 12.95 inches, and the cold was very great. The voyager
felt benumbed, and experienced difficulty of breathing; his throat was
parched and dry. So Lussac determined to return, he could go no higher.
He dropped gently near Rouen, and soon reached Paris. As soon as
possible the air in the flasks was submitted to very delicate tests, and to the
satisfaction of the scientists engaged it was found to be in exactly the same
proportions as that collected near the earth—two hundred and fifteen parts
of oxygen to every thousand of atmospheric air.</p>

<p>Messrs. Banal and Bixio, in 1850, also made some observations, and
found the temperature very variable. At 23,000 feet they found the
thermometer at <em>minus</em> 38·2° Fahr., which was much below the cold
experienced by Gay-Lussac. We may still conclude that the various
currents of the atmosphere cause considerable variation, and that it is
impossible to lay down anything respecting the degrees of heat and cold
likely to be found at certain elevations. We quote Arago’s observations
upon this ascent:—</p>

<p>“This discovery” (the ice particles found in the air) “explains how
these minute crystals may become the nucleus of large hailstones, for they
may condense round them the aqueous vapour contained in the portion of
the atmosphere where they exist. They go far to prove the truth of
Mariotte’s theory, according to which these crystals of ice suspended in the
air are the cause of parahelia—or mock-suns and mock-moons. Moreover,
the great extent of so cold a cloud explains very satisfactorily the sudden
changes of temperature which occur in our climates.”</p>

<p>M. Flammarion gives in his “Voyages” some very interesting and
amusing particulars, as well as many valuable scientific observations.
During one ascent he remarked that the shadow of the balloon was <em>white</em>,
and at another time dark. When white the surface upon which it fell
looked more luminous than any other part of the country! The phenomenon
was an <em>anthelion</em>. The absolute silence impressed the voyager
very much. He adds, “The silence was so oppressive that we cannot help
asking ourselves are we still alive! We appear to appertain no longer to
the world below.” M. Flammarion’s observations on the colour of what we
term the sky are worth quoting—not because they are novel, but because
they put so very clearly before us the appearance we call the “blue vault.”
He says,—speaking of the non-existence of the “celestial vault,”—“The air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
reflects the blue rays of the solar spectrum from every side. The white
light of the sun contains every colour, and the air allows all tints to pass
through it except the blue. This causes us to suppose the atmosphere is
blue. But the air has no such colour, and the tint in question is merely
owing to the reflection of light. Planetary space is absolutely black; the
higher we rise the thinner the layer of atmosphere that separates us from it,
and the darker the sky appears.”</p>

<p>Some beautiful effects may be witnessed at night from a balloon, and
considering the few accidents there have been in proportion to the number of
ascents, we do not wonder at balloon voyages being undertaken for mere
pleasure. When science has to be advanced there can be no objection made,
for then experience goes hand-in-hand with caution. It is only the ignorant
who are rash; the student of Nature learns to respect her, and to attend to her
admonitions and warnings in time. The details of the ascents of famous
aeronauts give us a great deal of pleasant and profitable reading. The
phenomena of the sky and clouds, and of the heavens, are all studied with
great advantage from a balloon, or “aerostat,” as it is the fashion to call it.
The grand phenomena of “Ulloa’s circles,” or <em>anthelia</em>, which represent the
balloon in air, and surrounded by a kind of glory, or aureola, like those
represented behind saintly heads, appear, as the name denotes, opposite to
the sun.</p>

<p>The various experiments made to ascertain the intensity of sounds have
resulted in the conclusion that they can be heard at great distances. For
instance, the steam whistle is distinctly audible 10,000 feet up in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
air, and human voices are heard at an altitude of 5,000 feet. A
man’s voice alone will penetrate more than 3,000 feet into the air;
and at that elevation the croaking of frogs is quite distinguishable. This
shows that sound ascends with ease, but it meets with great resistance in its
downward course, for the aeronaut cannot make himself audible to a listener
on the earth at a greater distance than 300 or 400 feet, though the latter
can be distinctly heard at an elevation of 1,600 feet. The diminution of
temperature noted by M. Flammarion is stated to be 1° Fahr. for every 345
feet on a fine day. On a cloudy day the mean decrease was 1° for
every 354 feet of altitude. The temperature of clouds is higher than the
air surrounding them, and the decrease is more rapid near the surface,
less rapid as the balloon ascends. We may add that at high elevations the
cork from a water-bottle will pop out as if from a champagne flask.</p>

<p>We have hitherto referred more to M. Flammarion and other French
aeronauts, but we must not be considered in any way oblivious of our
countrymen, Messrs. Glaisher, Green, and Coxwell, nor of the American,—one
of the most experienced of aerial voyagers,—Mr. Wise. The scientific
observations made by the French voyagers confirmed generally Mr. Glaisher’s
experiments. This noted air-traveller made twenty-eight ascents in the
cause of science, and his experiences related in “Travels in the Air,” and
in the “Reports” of the British Association, are both useful and entertaining.
For “Sensational ballooning” one wishes to go no farther than his account
of his experience with Mr. Coxwell, when (on the 5th of September, 1862)
he attained the greatest elevation ever reached, viz., seven miles, or thirty-seven
thousand feet.</p>

<p>We condense this exciting narrative for the benefit of those who have
not seen it already.</p>

<p>The ascent was made from Wolverhampton. At 1.39 p.m., the
balloon was four miles high, the temperature was 8°, and by the time the
fifth mile had been reached the mercury was below zero, and up to this
time observations had been made without discomfort, though Mr. Coxwell,
having exerted himself as aeronaut, found some difficulty in breathing.
About 2 o’clock, the balloon still ascending, Mr. Glaisher could not see the
mercury in the thermometer, and Mr. Coxwell had just then ascended into
the ring above the car to release the valve line which had become twisted.
Mr. Glaisher was able to note the barometer, however, and found it marked
10 inches, and was rapidly decreasing. It fell to 9&frac34; inches, and this
indicated an elevation of 29,000 feet! But the idea was to ascend
as high as possible, so the upward direction was maintained. “Shortly
afterwards,” writes Mr. Glaisher, “I laid my arm upon the table possessed
of its full vigour, and on being desirous of using it I found it powerless,—it
must have lost power momentarily. I tried to move the other
arm, and found it powerless also. I then tried to shake myself, and
succeeded in shaking my body. I seemed to have no limbs. I then looked
at the barometer, and whilst doing so my head fell on my left shoulder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Glaisher subsequently quite lost consciousness, and “black darkness”
came. While powerless he heard Mr. Coxwell speaking, and then
the words, “Do try, now do.” Then sight slowly returned, and rousing
himself, Mr. Glaisher said, “I have been insensible.” Mr. Coxwell replied,
“You have, and I, too, very nearly.” Mr. Coxwell’s hands were black, and
his companion had to pour brandy upon them. Mr. Coxwell’s situation was
a perilous one. He had lost the use of his hands, which were frozen, and
had to hang by his arms to the ring and drop into the car. He then perceived
his friend was insensible, and found insensibility coming on himself.
There was only one course to pursue—to pull the valve line and let the gas
escape, so as to descend. But his hands were powerless! As a last resource
he gripped the line with his teeth, and bending down his head, after many
attempts succeeded in opening the valve and letting the gas escape. The
descent was easily made, and accomplished in safety.</p>

</div>

<p>Some pigeons were taken up on this occasion, and were set free at
different altitudes. The first, at three miles, “dropped as a piece of paper”;
the second, at four miles, “flew vigorously round and round, apparently taking
a dip each time”; a third, a little later, “fell like a stone.” On descending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
a fourth was thrown out at four miles, and after flying in a circle, “alighted
on the top of the balloon.” Of the remaining pair one was dead when the
ground was gained, and the other recovered.</p>

<p>The observations noted are too numerous to be included here. Some,
we have seen, were confirmed by subsequent aeronauts, and as we have
mentioned them in former pages we need not repeat them. The results
differed very much under different conditions, and it is almost impossible to
decide upon any law. The direction of the wind in the higher and lower
regions sometimes differed, sometimes was the same, and so on. The
“Reports” of the British Association (1862-1866) will furnish full particulars
of all Mr. Glaisher’s experiments.</p>

<p>We have scarcely space left to mention the parachutes or umbrella-like
balloons which have occasionally been used. Its invention is traced to very
early times; but Garnerin was the first who descended in a parachute, in
1797, and continued to do so in safety on many subsequent occasions. The
parachute was suspended to a balloon, and at a certain elevation the voyager
let go and came down in safety. He ascended once from London, and let
go when 8,000 feet up. The parachute did not expand as usual, and fell at
a tremendous rate. At length it opened out, and the occupier of the car
came down forcibly, it is true, but safely. The form of the parachute is not
unlike an umbrella opened, with cords attaching the car to the extremities
of the “ribs,” the top of the basket car being fastened to the “stick” of the
umbrella.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Cocking invented a novel kind of parachute, but when he
attempted to descend by it from Mr. Green’s balloon it collapsed, and the
unfortunate voyager was dashed to pieces. His remains were found near
Lee, in Kent. Mr. Hampton did better on Garnerin’s principle, and made
several descents in safety and without injury.</p>

<p>The problem of flying in the air has attracted the notice of the
Aeronautical Society, established in 1873, but so far without leading to
practical results, though many daring and ingenious suggestions have been
put forth in the “Reports.”</p>

<p>It is not within our province to do more than refer to the uses of the
balloon for scientific purposes, but we may mention the services it was
employed upon during the French war, 1870-71. The investment of
Paris by the German army necessitated aerial communication, for no other
means were available. Balloon manufactories were established, and a great
number were made, and carried millions of letters to the provinces. Carrier-pigeons
were used to carry the return messages to the city, and photography
was applied to bring the correspondence into the smallest legible compass.
The many adventures of the aeronauts are within the recollection of all. A
few of the balloons never reappeared; some were carried into Norway, and
beyond the French frontier in other directions. The average capacity of
these balloons was 70,000 cubic feet.</p>

<p>Of course it will be understood how balloons are enabled to navigate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
air. The envelope being partly filled with coal-gas-heated air and hydrogen,
is much lighter than the surrounding atmosphere, and rises to a height
according as the density of the air strata diminishes. The density is less
as we ascend, and the buoyant force also is lessened in proportion. So
when the weight of the balloon and its occupants is the same as the power
of buoyancy, it will come to a stand, and go no higher. It can also be
understood that as the pressure of the outside becomes less, the expansive
force of the gas within becomes greater. We know that gas is very compressible,
and yet a little gas will fill a large space. Therefore, as the
balloon rises, it retains its rounded form, and appears full even at great
altitudes; but if the upper part were quite filled before it left the ground,
the balloon would inevitably burst at a certain elevation when the external
pressure of the air would be removed, unless an escape were provided. This
escape is arranged for by a valve at the top of the balloon, and the lower
part above the car is also left open very often, so that the gas can escape
of itself. When a rapid descent is necessary, the top valve is opened by
means of a rope, and the balloon sinks by its own weight. Mr. Glaisher
advises for great ascensions a balloon of a capacity of 90,000 cubic feet,
and only filled one-third of that capacity with gas. Six hundred pounds of
ballast should be taken.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_305.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 300.—Filling a balloon.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>A very small quantity of ballast thrown away will make a great difference;
a handful will raise the balloon many feet, and a chicken bone cast out
occasions a rise of thirty yards. The ballast is carried in small bags, and
consists of dry sand, which speedily dissipates in the air as it falls. By
throwing out ballast the aeronaut can ascend to a great height—in fact, as
high as he can go, the limit apparently for human existence being about
seven miles, when cold and rarefied air will speedily put an end to existence.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact, that however rapidly the balloon may be travelling
through the air, the occupants are not sensible of the motion. This, in part,
arises from the impossibility of comparing it with other objects. We pass
nothing stationary which would indicate the pace at which we travel. But
the absence of oscillation is also remarkable; even a glass of water may be
filled brim-full, and to such a level that the water is above the rim of the
glass, and yet not a drop will fall. This experiment was made by M.
Flammarion. When the aeronaut has ascended some distance the earth
loses its flat appearance, and appears as concave as the firmament above.
Guide ropes are usually attached to balloons, and as they rest upon the
ground they relieve the balloon of the amount of weight the length trailing
would cause. They thus act as a kind of substitute for ballast as the
balloon is descending. Most of the danger of aerial travelling lies in the
descent; and though in fine weather the aeronaut can calculate to a nicety
where he will descend, on a windy day, he must cast a grapnel, which catches
with an ugly jerk, and the balloon bounds and strains at her moorings.</p>

<p>Although many attempts have been made to guide balloons through
the air, no successful apparatus has ever been completed for use. Paddles,
sails, fans, and screws have all been tried, but have failed to achieve the
desired end. Whether man will ever be able to fly we cannot of course say.
In the present advancing state of science it may not be impossible ere long
to supply human beings with an apparatus worked by electricity, perhaps,
which will enable them to mount into the air and sustain themselves. But
even the bird cannot always fly without previous momentum. A rook will
run before it rises, and many other birds have to “get up steam,” as it were,
before they can soar in the atmosphere. Eagles and such heavy birds find
it very difficult to rise from the ground. We know that vultures when
gorged cannot move at all, or certainly cannot fly away; and eagles take
up their positions on high rocks, so that they may launch down on their
prey, and avoid the difficulty of rising from the ground. They swoop down
with tremendous momentum and carry off their booty, but often lose their
lives from the initial difficulty of soaring immediately. We fear man’s
weight will militate against his ever becoming a flying animal. When we
obtain a knowledge of the atmospheric currents we shall no doubt be able
to navigate our balloons; but until then—and the information is as yet
very limited, and the currents themselves very variable—we must be content
to rise and fall in the air, and travel at the will of the wind in the upper
regions of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Chemistry is the science of phenomena which are attended by a change
of the objects which produce them. We know that when a candle burns, or
when wood is burned, or even a piece of metal becomes what we term
“rusty,” that certain chemical changes take place. There is a change by
what is termed chemical action. Rust on iron is not iron; it is oxide of
iron. The oxygen of the air causes it. So we endeavour, by Chemistry, to
find out the nature of various bodies, their changes, and the results.</p>

<p>In nature we have simple and compound bodies. The former are
called <span class="smcap">Elements</span>. We must not confuse these elements with the so-called
elements—earth, air, fire, and water. These are really compound bodies.
An element is a substance or a gas which is not composed of more than one
constituent; <em>it is itself</em>—a compound of perfectly identical particles. Every
“compound” body, therefore, must be made up of some of the elements, of
which there are sixty-five. These bodies are divided into non-metallic and
metallic elements, and all bodies are composed of them, or are these bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
themselves. The list is as follows. The non-metallic elements are
“metalloids.” We have omitted fractions from the weights, on which
chemists differ.</p>

<p>The term “combining weight” requires a little explanation. We are
aware that water, for instance, is made up of oxygen and hydrogen in
certain proportions. This we will prove by-and-by. The proportions are
in eighteen grains or parts of water, sixteen parts (by weight) of oxygen,
and two parts (by weight) of hydrogen. These are the weights or proportions
in which oxygen and hydrogen combine to form water, and such
weights are always the same in these proportions. Chemical combination
always occurs for certain substances in certain proportions which never vary
in those compounds, and if we wish to extract oxygen from an oxide we
must take the aggregate amount of the combining weights of the oxide, and
we shall find the proportion of oxygen; for the compound always weighs
the same as the sum of the elements that compose it. To return to the
illustration of water. The molecule of water is made up of one atom of
oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen. One atom of the former weighs sixteen
times the atom of the latter. The weights given in the foregoing
table are <em>atomic</em> weights, and the law of their proportions is called the
Atomic Theory.</p>

<p>An <em>atom</em> in chemistry is usually considered the smallest quantity of
matter that exists, and is indivisible. A <em>molecule</em> is supposed to contain
two or more atoms, and is the smallest portion of a compound body. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
standard atom is hydrogen, which is put down as 1, because we find that
when one part by weight of hydrogen is put in combination, it must have
many more parts <em>by weight</em> of others to form a compound. Two grains
of hydrogen, combining with sixteen of oxygen, makes eighteen of water, as
we have already seen.</p>

<p>Take an example so plainly given by Professor Roscoe, remembering
that the numbers in our table represent the fixed weight or proportion by
weight in which the simple body combines. The red oxide of mercury
contains sixteen parts by weight of oxygen to two hundred parts by weight
of mercury (we see the same numbers in the table); these combined make
two hundred and sixteen parts of oxide. So to obtain 16 lbs. of oxygen
we must get 216 lbs. of the powder. It is the same all through, and it will
be found by experiment that if any more parts than these fixed proportions
be taken to form a compound, some of that element used in excess will
remain free. Lime is made up of calcium and oxygen. We find calcium
combining weight is forty, oxygen sixteen. Lime is oxide of calcium in
these proportions (by weight).</p>

<p>When we wish to express the number of atoms in a compound we write
the number underneath when more than one; thus water is H<sub>2</sub>O. Sulphuric
acid H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. As we proceed we will give the various formulæ when considering
the chief elements.</p>

<p>In chemistry we have acids, alkalis, and salts, with metallic oxides,
termed <em>bases</em>, or bodies, that when combined with <em>acids</em> form <em>salts</em>. Alkalis
are bases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acids</span> are compounds which possess an acid taste, impart red colour to
vegetable blues, but lose their qualities when combined with bases. Hydrogen
is present in all acids. There are insoluble acids. Silicic acid, for instance,
is not soluble in water, has no sour taste, and will not redden the test litmus
paper. On the other hand, there are substances (not acids) which possess
the characteristics of acids, and most acids have only one or two of these
characteristics.</p>

<p>Thus it has come to pass that the term “acid” has in a measure dropped
out from scientific nomenclature, and salt of hydrogen has been substituted
by chemists. For popular exposition, however, the term is retained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alkalis</span> are bases distinguished by an alkaline taste. The derivation
is from Arabic, <i lang="ar">al-kali</i>. They are characterized by certain properties, and they
change vegetable blues to green, and will restore the blue to a substance
which has been reddened by acid. They are soluble in water, and the
solutions are caustic in their effects. Potash, soda, and ammonia are alkalis, or
chemically, the oxides of potassium, sodium, ammonium, lithium, and cæsium
are all alkalis. Potash is sometimes called “caustic” potash. There are alkaline
earths, such as oxides of barium, strontium, etc. <em>Bases</em> may be defined as
the converse of acids.</p>

<p>Acids and alkalis are then evidently opposite in character, and yet they
readily combine, and in chemistry we shall find that unlike bodies are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
fond of combining (just as opposite electricities attract each other), and the
body made by this combination differs in its properties from its constituents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salts</span> are composed of acids and bases, and are considered neutral
compounds, but there are other bodies not salts, which likewise come under
that definition—sugar, for instance. As a rule, when acids and alkalis combine
<em>salts</em> are found.</p>

<p>Chemical phenomena are divided into two groups, called <em>inorganic</em> and
<em>organic</em>, comprising the simple and compound aspects of the subject, the
elementary substances being in the first, and the chemistry of animals or
vegetables, or organic substances, in the latter. In the inorganic section we
shall become acquainted with the elements and their combinations so often
seen as <em>minerals</em> in nature. Chemical <em>preparations</em> are artificially prepared.
To consider these elements we must have certain appliances, and indeed a
laboratory is needed. Heat, as we have already seen, plays a great part in
developing substances, and by means of heat we can do a great deal in the
way of chemical decomposition. It expands, and thus diminishes cohesion;
it counteracts the chemical attraction. Light and electricity also decompose
chemical combinations. But before proceeding it will be as well to notice a
few facts showing how Nature has balanced all things.</p>

<p>The earth, and its surrounding envelope, the atmosphere, consist of a
number of elements, which in myriad combinations give us everything we
possess,—the air we breathe, the water we drink, the fire that warms us, are
all made up of certain elements or gases. Water, hydrogen and oxygen;
air, oxygen and nitrogen. Fire is combustion evolving light and heat.
Chemical union always evolves heat, and when such union proceeds very
rapidly fire is the result.</p>

<p>In all these combinations we shall find when we study chemistry that
not a particle or atom of matter is ever lost. It may change or combine or
be “given off,” but the matter in some shape or way exists still. We may
burn things, and rid ourselves, as we think, of them. We do rid ourselves of
the compounds, the elements remain somewhere. We only alter the <em>condition</em>.
During combustion, as in a candle or a fire, the simple bodies assume gaseous
or other forms, such as carbon, but they do not escape far. True they pass
beyond our ken, but nature is so nicely balanced that there is a place for
everything, and everything is in its place under certain conditions which
never alter. We cannot <em>destroy</em> and we cannot <em>create</em>. We may prepare a
combination, and science has even succeeded in producing a form like the
diamond—a crystal of carbon which looks like that most beautiful of all crystals,
but we cannot make a diamond after all. We can only separate the chemical
compounds. We can turn diamonds into charcoal it is true, but we cannot
create “natural” products. We can take a particle of an element and hide
it, or let it pass beyond our ken, and remain incapable of detection, but the
particle is there all the time, and when we retrace our steps we shall find it
as it was before.</p>

<p>This view of chemistry carries it as a science beyond the mere holiday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
amusement we frequently take it to be. It is a grand study, a study for a
lifetime. Nature is always willing, like a kind, good mother as she is, to
render us up her secrets if we inquire respectfully and lovingly. The more
we inquire the more we shall find we have to learn. In these and the
following pages we can only tell you a few things, but no one need be
turned away because he does not find all he wants. We never do get all
we want in life, and there are many first-rate men—scientists—who would
give “half their kingdom” for a certain bit of knowledge concerning some
natural phenomena. There are numerous excellent treatises on chemistry,
and exhaustive as they are, at present they do not tell us all. Let these
popular pages lead us to the study of nature, and we shall find our labour
far from onerous and full of interest, daily increasing to the end, when we
shall know no more of earth, or chemistry.</p>

<p>As a preliminary we will put our workshop aside, and show you something
of <cite>Chemistry without a Laboratory</cite>.</p>

<small>CHEMISTRY WITHOUT A LABORATORY.</small></h2>


<p>We have already pointed out the possibility of going through a course of
physics without any special apparatus, we shall now endeavour to show our
readers the method of performing some experiments in chemistry without a
laboratory, or at any rate with only a few simple and inexpensive appliances.
The preparation of gases, such as hydrogen, carbonic acid, and oxygen, is
very easily accomplished, but we shall here point out principally a series of
experiments that are not so much known. We will commence, for example,
by describing an interesting experiment which often occurs in a course of
chemistry. Ammoniacal gas combined with the elements of water is
analogous to a metallic oxide which includes a metallic root, <em>ammonium</em>.
This hypothetically composed metal may be in a manner perceived, since it
is possible to amalgamate it with mercury by operating in the following
manner:—We take a porcelain mortar, in which we pour a quantity of
mercury, and then cut some thin strips of sodium, which are thrown into the
mercury. By stirring it about with the pestle a loud cracking is produced,
accompanied by a flame, which bears evidence to the union of the mercury
and the sodium, and the formation of an amalgam of sodium. If this
amalgam of sodium is put into a slender glass tube containing a concentrated
solution of hydrochlorate of ammonia in water, we see the ammonia
expand in an extraordinary manner, and spout out from the end of the tube,
which is now too small to contain it, in the form of a metallic substance
(fig. 302). In this case, the ammonium, the radical which exists in the
ammoniacal salts, becomes amalgamated with the mercury, driving out the
sodium with which it had previously been combined; the ammonium thus
united with the mercury becomes decomposed in ammoniacal gas and
hydrogen, the mercury assuming its ordinary form. Phosphate of ammonia
is very valuable from its property of rendering the lightest materials, such as
gauze or muslin, incombustible. Dip a piece of muslin in a solution of
phosphate of ammonia, and dry it in contact with the air; that done, you
will find it is impossible to set fire to the material; it will get charred, but
you cannot make it burn. It is to be wished that this useful precaution were
oftener taken in the matter of ball-dresses, which have so frequently been the
cause of serious accidents. There is no danger whatever with a dress that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
has been soaked in phosphate of ammonia, which is very inexpensive, and
easily procured.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_314.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 302.—Experiment with ammonium.</div>
</div>

<p>For preparing cool drinks in the summer ammoniacal salts are very
useful; some <em>nitrate of ammonia</em> mixed with its weight in water, produces a
considerable lowering of the temperature, and is very useful for making ice.
<em>Volatile alkali</em>, which is so useful an application for stings from insects, is a
solution of ammoniacal gas in water, and <em>sal-volatile</em>, which has such a
refreshing and reanimating odour, is a carbonate of ammonia. We often
see in chemists’ shops large glass jars, the insides of which are covered with
beautiful transparent white crystals, which are formed over a red powder
placed at the bottom of the vase. These crystals are the result of a
combination of cyanogen and iodine. Nothing is easier than the preparation
of <em>iodide of cyanogen</em>, a very volatile body, which possesses a strong tendency
to assume a definite crystalline form. We pound in a mortar a mixture of
50 grams of cyanide of mercury, and 100 grams of iodine; under the action
of the pestle the powder, which was at first a brownish colour, assumes a
shade of bright vermilion red. The cyanogen combines with the iodine,
and transforms itself into fumes with great rapidity. If the powder is
placed at the bottom of a stoppered glass jar, the fumes of the iodide of
cyanogen immediately condense, thereby producing beautiful crystals which
often attain considerable size (fig. 303). Cyanogen forms with sulphur a
remarkable substance, <em>sulpho-cyanogen</em>, the properties of which we cannot
describe without exceeding the limits of our present treatise; we shall therefore
confine ourselves to pointing out one of its combinations, which is well
known at the present day, owing to its singular properties. This is sulpho-cyanide
of mercury, with which small combustible cones are made, generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
designated by the pompous title of <em>Pharaoh’s serpents</em>. For making these,
some sulpho-cyanide of potassium is poured into a solution of nitrate acid on
mercury, which forms a precipitate of sulpho-cyanide of mercury. This is a
white, combustible powder, which after passing through a filter, should be
transformed into a stiff pulp by means of water containing a solution of gum.
The pulp is afterwards mixed with a small quantity of nitrate of potash,
and fashioned into cones or cylinders of about an inch and a quarter in
length, which should be thoroughly dried. The egg thus obtained can be
hatched by the simple application of a lighted match, and gives rise to the
phenomenon. The sulpho-cyanide slowly expands, the cylinder increases in
length, and changes to a yellowish substance, which dilates and extends to a
length of twenty or five-and-twenty inches. It has the appearance of a
genuine serpent, which has just started into existence, and stretches out its
tortuous coils, endeavouring to escape from its narrow prison (fig. 304).
The residue is composed partly of cyanide of mercury and of para-cyanogen;
it constitutes a very poisonous substance, which should be immediately
thrown away or burned. It can be easily powdered into dust in the fingers.
During the decomposition of the sulpho-cyanide of mercury, quantities of
sulphurous acid are thrown off, and it is to be regretted that Pharaoh’s
serpent should herald his appearance by such a disagreeable, suffocating
odour.</p>

<p>After these few preliminary experiments, we will endeavour to show
the interest afforded by the study of chemistry in relation to the commonest
substances of every-day life. We will first consider the nature of a few
pinches of salt. We know that kitchen salt, or sea salt, is white or greyish,
according to its degree of purity; that it has a peculiar flavour, is soluble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
in water, and makes a peculiar crackling when thrown in the fire. But
though its principal physical properties may be familiar enough, many people
are entirely ignorant of its chemical nature and elementary composition.
Kitchen salt contains a metal, combined with a gas possessing a very suffocating
odour; the metal is <em>sodium</em>, the gas is <em>chlorine</em>. The scientific name for
the substance is <em>chloride of sodium</em> (salt).<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> The metal contained in common
salt in no way resembles ordinary metals; it is white like silver, but tarnishes
immediately in contact with air, and unites with oxygen, thus transforming
itself into <em>oxide of sodium</em>. To preserve this singular metal it is necessary
to protect it from the action of the atmosphere, and to keep it in a bottle
containing oil of naptha. Sodium is soft, and it is possible with a pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
scissors to cut it like a ball of soft bread that has been kneaded in the
hand. It is lighter than water, and when placed in a basin of water floats
on the top like a piece of cork; only it is disturbed, and takes the form of
a small brilliant sphere; great effervescence is
also produced as it floats along, for it reduces
the water to a common temperature by its
contact. By degrees the small metallic ball
disappears from view, after blazing into flame
(fig. 305).</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_317.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 305.—Combustion of sodium in water.</div>
</div>

<p>This remarkable experiment is very easy
to carry out, and sodium is now easily procured
at any shop where chemicals are sold.
The combustion of sodium in water can be
explained in a very simple manner. Water,
as we know, is composed of hydrogen and oxygen. Sodium, by reason of
its great affinity for the latter gas, combines with it, and forms a very
soluble oxide; the hydrogen is released and thrown off, as we shall perceive
by placing a lighted match in the jar, when the combustible gas ignites.</p>

<p>Oxide of sodium has a great affinity for water; it combines with it,
and absorbs it in great quantities. It is a solid, white substance, which burns
and cauterizes the skin; it is also <em>alkaline</em>, and brings back the blue colour
to litmus paper that has been reddened by acids.</p>

<p>Sodium combines easily also with chlorine. If plunged into a jar
containing this gas it is transformed into a substance, which is sea salt. If
the chlorine is in excess a part of the gas remains free, for simple substances
do not mingle in undetermined ratios; they combine, on the contrary, in
very definite proportions, and 35·5 gr. of dry chlorine always unites with
the same quantity of soda equal to 23 grams. A gram of kitchen salt is
formed, therefore, of 0·606 gr. of chlorine, and 0·394 gr. of sodium. Besides
sea salt, there are a number of different salts which may be made the object
of curious experiments. We know that caustic soda, or oxide of sodium,
is an alkaline product possessing very powerful properties; it burns the
skin, and destroys organic substances.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid is endowed with no less powerful properties; if a little
is dropped on the hand it produces great pain and a sense of burning; a
piece of wood plunged into this acid is almost immediately carbonized. If we
mix forty-nine grams of sulphuric acid and thirty-one grams of caustic soda a
very intense reaction is produced, accompanied by a considerable elevation of
temperature; after it has cooled we have a substance which can be handled
with impunity; the acid and alkali have combined, and their properties
have been reciprocally destroyed. They have now originated a <em>salt</em> which
is <em>sulphate of soda</em>. This substance exercises no influence on litmus paper,
and resembles in no way the substances from which it originated.</p>

<p>There are an infinite number of salts which result in like manner from
the combination of an acid with an alkali or <em>base</em>. Some, such as sulphate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
of copper, or chromate of potash, are coloured; others, like sulphate of soda,
are colourless. The last-mentioned salt, with a number of others, will take
a crystalline form; if dissolved in boiling water, and the solution left to
stand, we shall perceive a deposit of transparent prisms of very remarkable
appearance. This was discovered by Glauber, and was formerly called
<em>Glauber’s salts</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_318.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 306.—Preparation of a solution saturated with sulphate of soda.</div>
</div>

<p>Sulphate of soda is very soluble in water, and at a temperature of thirty-three
(Centigr.) water can dissolve it in the greatest degree. If we pour a
layer of oil on a solution saturated with Glauber’s salts, and let it stand, it
will not produce crystals; but if we thrust a glass rod through the oil into
contact with the solution, crystallization will be instantaneous. This singular
phenomenon becomes even more striking when we put the warm concentrated
solution into a slender glass tube, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, which we close after having driven
out the air by the bubbling of the liquid (fig. 306). When the tube has
been closed, the crystals of sulphate of soda will not form, even with the
temperature at zero; nevertheless the salts, being less soluble cold than hot,
are found in the fluid in a proportion ten times larger than they would
contain under ordinary conditions. If the end of the tube be broken the
salt will crystallize immediately. We will describe another experiment, but
little known and very remarkable, which exhibits in a striking manner the
process of instantaneous crystallizations. Let one hundred and fifty parts
of hyposulphite of soda be dissolved in fifteen parts of water, and the solution
slowly poured into a test-glass, previously warmed by means of boiling
water, until the vessel is about half-full. One hundred parts of acetate of
soda is then dissolved in fifteen parts of water, and poured slowly into the
first solution, so that they form two layers perfectly distinct from each other.
The two solutions are then covered with a little boiling water, which, however
is not represented in our illustration. After it has been left to stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
and cool slowly, we have two solutions of hyposulphite of soda and acetate
of soda superposed on each other. A thread, at the end of which is fixed
a small crystal of hyposulphite of soda, is then lowered into the test-glass;
the crystal passes through the solution of acetate without disturbing it, but
it has scarcely reached the lower solution of hyposulphite than the salt
crystallizes instantaneously. (<i>See</i> the test-glass on the left of fig. 307.)
We then lower into the upper solution a crystal of acetate of soda, suspended
from another thread. This salt then crystallizes also. (<i>See</i> experiment glass
on the right of fig. 307.) This very successful experiment is one of the
most remarkable belonging to the subject of instantaneous crystals. The
successive appearance of crystals of hyposulphite of soda, which take the
form of large, rhomboidal prisms, terminating at the two extremities with
an oblique surface, and the crystals of acetate of soda, which have the
appearance of rhomboidal, oblique prisms, cannot fail to strike the attention
and excite the interest of those who are not initiated into these kinds of
experiments.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 307.—Experiment of instantaneous crystallization.</div>
</div>

<p>Another remarkable instantaneous crystallization is that of alum. If
we leave standing a solution of this salt it gradually cools, at the same time
becoming limpid and clear. When it is perfectly cold, if we plunge into it
a small octahedral crystal of alum suspended from a thread, we perceive
that crystallization instantly commences on the surface of the small crystal;
it rapidly and perceptibly increases in size, until it nearly fills the whole jar.</p>

<p>How many invalids have swallowed <em>magnesia</em> without suspecting that
this powder contains a metal nearly as white as silver, and is malleable, and
capable of burning with so intense a light that it rivals even the electric
light in brilliancy! If any of our readers desire to prepare magnesium themselves
it can be done in the following manner:—Some white magnesia must
be obtained from the chemist, and after having been calcined, must be submitted
to the influence of hydrochloric acid and hydrochlorate of ammonia.
A clear solution will thus be obtained, which by means of evaporation under
the influence of heat, furnishes a double chloride, hydrated and crystallised.
This chloride, if heated to redness in an earthenware crucible, leaves as a
residue a nacreous product, composed of micaceous, white scales, chloride of
anhydrous magnesium.</p>

<p>If six hundred grams of this chloride of magnesium are mixed with one
hundred grams of chloride of sodium, or kitchen salt, and the same quantity
of fluoride of calcium and metallic sodium in small fragments, and the
mixture is put into an earthenware crucible made red-hot, and heated for a
quarter of an hour under a closed lid, we shall find on pouring out the fluid
on to a handful of earth, that we have obtained instead of scoria, forty-five
grams of metallic magnesium. The metal thus obtained is impure, and to
remove all foreign substances it must be heated in a charcoal tube, through
which passes a current of hydrogen.</p>

<p>Magnesium is now produced in great abundance, and is very inexpensive.
It is a metal endowed with a great affinity for oxygen, and it is only
necessary to thrust it into the flame of a candle to produce combustion; it
burns with a brightness that the eye can scarcely tolerate, and is transformed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
into a white powder—oxide of magnesium, or magnesia. Combustion is still
more active in oxygen, and powder of magnesium placed
in a jar filled with this gas produces a perfect shower of
fire of very beautiful effect. To give an idea of the
lighting power of magnesium, we may add that a wire of
this metal, which is 29/100 of a millimetre in diameter,
produces by combustion a light equal to that of seventy-four
candles.</p>

<p>The humble earth of the fields—the clay which
is used in our potteries, also contains aluminium, that
brilliant metal which is as malleable as silver, and unspoilable
as gold. When clay is submitted to the influence
of sulphuric acid and chloride of potassium, we obtain alum, which is a
sulphate of alumina and potash. Alum is a colourless salt, which crystallizes
on the surface of water in beautiful octahedrons of striking regularity. Fig.
308 represents a group of alum crystals. This salt is much used in the
colouring of fabrics; it is also used for the sizing of papers, and the clarification
of tallow. Doctors also use it as an astringent and caustic substance.
When alum is submitted to the action of heat in an earthenware crucible, it
loses the water of crystallization which it contains, and expands in a singular
manner, overflowing from the jar in which it is calcined (fig. 309).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 310.—Preparation of metallic iron.</div>
</div>

<p>Iron, the most important of common metals, rapidly unites with oxygen,
and, as we know, when a piece of this metal is exposed to the influence of
damp air, it becomes covered with a reddish substance. In the well-known
experiment of the formation of rust, the iron gradually oxidises without its
temperature rising, but this combination of iron with oxygen is effected much
more rapidly under the influence of heat. If, for example, we redden at the
fire a nail attached to a wire, and give it a movement of rotation as of a
sling, we see flashing out from the metal a thousand bright sparks due to the
combination of iron with oxygen, and the formation of an oxide. Particles
of iron burn spontaneously in contact with air, and this property for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
centuries has been utilized in striking a tinder-box; that is to say, in separating,
by striking a flint, small particles of iron, which ignite under the influence
of the heat produced by the friction. We can prepare iron in such atoms that
it ignites at an ordinary temperature by simple contact with the air. To
bring it to this state of extreme tenuity, we reduce its oxalate by hydrogen.
We prepare an apparatus for hydrogen as shown in fig. 310, and the gas produced
at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> is passed through a desiccative tube, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, and finally reaches a glass
receptacle, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, in which some oxalate of iron is placed. The latter salt, under
the combined influence of hydrogen and heat, is reduced to metallic iron,
which assumes the appearance of a fine black powder. When the experiment
is completed the glass vessel is closed, and the iron, thus protected from
contact with the air, can be preserved indefinitely; but if it is exposed to the
air by breaking off the end of the receptacle (fig. 311), it ignites immediately,
producing a shower of fire of very beautiful effect. Iron thus prepared
is known under the name of <em>pyrophoric iron</em>. Iron is acted upon in a
very powerful manner by most acids. If some nitric acid is poured on iron
nails, a stream of red, nitrous vapour is let loose, and the oxidised iron is
dissolved in the liquid to the condition of nitrate of iron. This experiment
is very easy to perform, and it gives an idea of the energy of certain chemical
actions. We have endeavoured to represent its appearance in fig. 312.
Fuming nitric acid does not act on iron, and prevents it being attacked by
ordinary nitric acid. This property has given rise to a very remarkable
experiment on passive iron. It consists in placing some nails in a glass,
into which some fuming nitric acid is poured, which produces no result;
the fuming acid is then taken out, and is replaced by ordinary nitric acid,
which no longer acts on the iron rendered passive by the smoking acid. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
this, if the nails are touched by a piece of iron, which has not undergone the
action of nitric acid, they are immediately acted upon, and a giving off of
nitrous vapour is manifested with great energy. Lead is a very soft metal,
and can even be scratched by the nails. It is also extremely pliable, and
so entirely devoid of elasticity that when bent it has no tendency whatever to
return to its primitive form. Lead is heavy, and has a density represented
by 11·4; that is to say, the weight of a quart of water being one kilogram,
that of the same volume of lead is 11·400 k.</p>

<p>Lead, like tin, is capable of taking a beautiful crystalline form when
placed in solution by a metal that is less oxydisable. The crystallization of
lead, represented in fig. 314, is designated by the name of the <em>Tree of Saturn</em>.
This is how the experiment is produced: Thirty grams of acetate of lead are
dissolved in a quart of water, and the solution is poured into a vase of a
spherical shape. A stopper for this vase is made out of a piece of zinc, to
which five or six separate brass wires are attached; these are plunged into
the fluid, and we see the wires become immediately covered with brilliant
crystallized spangles of lead, which continue increasing in size.</p>

<p>The alchemists, who were familiar with this experiment, believed that
it consisted in a transformation of copper into lead, while in reality it only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
consists in the substitution of one metal for another. The copper is dissolved
in the liquid, and is replaced by the lead, but no metamorphosis is
brought about. We may vary at will the form of the
vase or the arrangement of the wire; thus it is easy
to form letters, numbers, or figures, by the crystallization
of brilliant spangles.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 313.—Representation of bars of metal, all of the same weight.</div>

<p>Copper, when it is pure, has a characteristic red
colour, which prevents it being confounded with any
other metal; it dissolves easily in nitric acid, and
with considerable effervescence, giving off vapour very
abundantly. This property has been put to good use
in engraving with aqua fortis. A copper plate is
covered with a layer of varnish, and when it is dry
some strokes are made on it by means of a graver;
if nitric acid is poured on the plate when thus prepared,
the copper is only acted on in the parts that
have been exposed by the point of steel. By afterwards
removing the varnish, we have an engraved
plate, which will serve for printing purposes.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 314.—Tree of Saturn.</div>
</div>

<p>Among experiments that may be attempted with common metals, we
may mention that in which salts of tin are employed. Tin has a great
tendency to assume a crystalline form, and it will be easy to show
this property by an interesting experiment. A concentrated solution
of proto-chloride of tin, prepared by dissolving some metallic tin in
hydrochloric acid, is placed in a test glass; then a rod of tin is
introduced, as shown in fig. 315. Some water is next slowly poured on
the rod, so that it gradually trickles down, and prevents the mingling
of the proto-chloride of tin. The vessel is then left to stand,
and we soon see brilliant crystals starting out from the rod. This
crystallization is not effected in the water; it is explained by an
electric influence, into the details of which we cannot enter without
overstepping our limits; it is known as “Jupiter’s Tree.” It is well
known that alchemists, with their strange system of nomenclature,
believed there was a certain mysterious relation between the seven
metals then known and the seven planets; each metal was dedicated to
a planet; tin was called Jupiter; silver,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> Luna; gold, Sol;
lead, Saturn; iron, Mars; quicksilver, Mercury; and copper, Venus.
The crystallization of tin may be recognised also by rubbing a piece
of this metal with hydrochloric acid; the fragments thus rubbed off
exhibit specimens of branching crystals similar to the hoar-frost which
we see in severe winter weather. If we bend a rod of tin in our hands
the crystals break, with a peculiar rustling sound.</p>

<p>When speaking of precious metals, we may call to mind that the alchemists
considered gold as the king of metals, and the other valuable ones as
noble metals. This definition is erroneous, if we look upon the useful as the
most precious; for, in that case, iron and copper would be placed in the
first rank. If gold were found abundantly on the surface of the soil, and
iron was extremely rare, we should seek most eagerly for this useful metal,
and should despise the former, with which we can neither make a ploughshare
nor any other implement of industry. Nevertheless, the scarcity of
gold, its beautiful yellow colour, and its unalterability when in contact with
air, combine to place it in the first rank in the list of precious metals. Gold
is very heavy; its density is represented by the figure 19·5. It is the most
malleable and the most ductile of metals, and can be reduced by beating to
such thin sheets that ten thousand can be laid, one over the other, to obtain
the thickness of a millimetre. With a grain of gold a thread may be manufactured
extending a league in length, and so fine that it resembles a spider’s
web. When gold is beaten into thin sheets it is no longer opaque; if it is
fastened, by means of a solution of gum, on to a sheet of glass, the light
passes right through it, and presents a very perceptible green shade. Gold
is sometimes found scattered in sand, in a condition of impalpable dust, and,
in certain localities, in irregular lumps of varying size, called nuggets. Gold
is the least alterable of the metals, and can be exposed, indefinitely, to the
contact of humid atmosphere without oxidizing. It is not acted on by the
most powerful acids, and only dissolves in a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric
acid. We can prove that gold resists the influence of acids by the
following operation:—</p>

<p>Some gold-leaf is placed in two small phials, the first containing hydrochloric
acid, and the second nitric acid. The two vessels are warmed on
the stove, and whatever the duration of the ebullition of the acids, the gold-leaf
remains intact, and completely resists their action. If we then empty
the contents of one phial into the other, the hydrochloric and nitric acids
are mixed, and we see the gold-leaf immediately disappear, easily dissolved
by the action of the liquid (<i lang="la">aqua regia</i>). Gold also changes when in contact
with mercury; this is proved by suspending some gold-leaf above the surface
of this liquid (fig. 316); it quickly changes, and unites with the fumes of the
mercury, becoming of a greyish colour.</p>

<p>Silver is more easily affected than gold, and though so white when
fused, tarnishes rapidly in contact with air. It does not oxidize, but
sulphurizes under the influence of hydro-sulphuric emanations. Silver
does not combine directly with the oxygen of the atmosphere; but under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
certain conditions it can dissolve great quantities of this gas. If it is fused
in a small bone cupel, in contact with the air, and left to cool quickly, it
expands in a remarkable manner, and gives off oxygen.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_326.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 315.—Jupiter’s Tree.</div>
</div>

<p>Nitric acid dissolves silver very easily, by causing the formation of
abundant fumes. When the solution evaporates, we perceive white crystals
forming, which are nitrate of silver. This fused nitrate of silver takes the
name of <em>lunar caustic</em>, and is employed in medicine. Nitrate of silver is
very poisonous; it possesses the singular property of turning black under
the action of the sun’s rays, and is used in many curious operations in
photography. It is also employed in the manufacture of dyes for the hair;
it is applied to white hair with gall-nut, and under the influence of the light
it turns black, and gives the hair a very dark shade. Salts of silver in
solution with water have the property of forming a precipitate under the
influence of chlorides, such as sea salt. If a few grains of common salt are
thrown into a solution of nitrate of silver, it forms an abundant precipitate
of chloride of silver, which blackens in the light. This precipitate,
insoluble in nitric acid, dissolves very easily in ammonia.</p>

<p>Platinum, which is the last of the precious metals that we have to
consider, is a greyish-white colour, and like gold is only affected by a
mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid. It is the heaviest of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
ordinary metals; its density is 21·50. It is very malleable and ductile,
and can be beaten into very thin sheets, and into wires as slender as wires
of gold. Platinum wires have even been made so fine that the eye can
scarcely perceive them; these are known as Wollaston’s invisible wires.
Platinum resists the action of the most intense fire, and we can only fuse it
by means of a blow-pipe and hydro-oxide gas. Its inalterability and the
resistance it opposes to fire render it very valuable for use in the laboratory.
Small crucibles are made of it, which are used by chemists to calcine their
precipitates in analytical operations, or to bring about reactions under the
influence of a high temperature. Platinum may be reduced to very small
particles; it then takes the form of a black powder. In this pulverulent
condition it absorbs gases with great rapidity, to such an extent that a
cubic centimetre can condense seven hundred and fifty times its own volume
of hydrogen gas. It also condenses oxygen, and in a number of cases acts
as a powerful agent. Platinum is also obtained in porous masses (“spongy
platinum”), which produce phenomena of oxidation.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 316.—Gold-leaf exposed to the fumes of mercury.</div>
</div>

<p>A very ingenious little lamp may be constructed which lights of itself
without the help of a flame. It contains a bell of glass, which is filled with
hydrogen gas, produced by the action exercised by a foundation of zinc on
acidulated water. If the knob on the upper part of the apparatus is
pressed, the hydrogen escapes, and comes in contact with a piece of spongy
platinum, which, acting by oxidation, becomes ignited. The flame produced
sets fire to a small oil lamp, which is opposite the jet of gas. This very
ingenious lamp is known under the name of Gay-Lussac’s lamp. Platinum
can also produce, by mere contact, a great number of chemical reactions.
Place in a test glass an explosive mixture formed of two volumes of hydrogen
and one volume of oxygen; in this gas plunge a small piece of spongy platinum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
and the combination of the two bodies will be instantly brought about, making
a violent explosion. Make a small spiral of platinum red-hot in the flame of
a lamp, having suspended it to a card; then plunge it quickly into a glass
containing ether, and you will see the metallic spiral remain red for some time,
while in the air it would cool immediately. This phenomenon is due to the
action of oxidation which the platinum exercises over the fumes of ether.
This curious experiment is known under the name of <em>the lamp without a
flame</em>. This remarkable oxidizing power of platinum, which has not yet been
explained, was formerly designated by the title of <em>catalytic action</em>. But a
phrase is not a theory, and it is always preferable to avow one’s ignorance
than to simulate an apparent knowledge. Science is powerful enough to be
able to express her doubts and uncertainties boldly. In observing nature
we find an experience of this, and often meet with facts which may be put
to profit, and become useful in application; nevertheless it is often the case
that the why and the wherefore will for a long time escape the most
penetrating eye and lucid intelligence. It is true the admirable applications
of science strike us with the importance of their results, and the
wonderful inventions they originate; but if they turn to account the observed
facts of nature, what do they teach us as to the first cause of all things,
the <em>wherefore</em> of nature?—Almost nothing. We must humbly confess our
powerlessness, and say with d’Alembert: “The encyclopædia is very abundant,
but what of that if it discourses of what we do not understand?”</p>

properties, destroys the colour of many flowers, such as roses,
periwinkles, etc. The experiment succeeds very readily by means of the
little apparatus which we give in fig. 317. We dissolve in a small vessel
some sulphur, which ignites in contact with air, and gives rise, by its combination
with oxygen, to sulphurous acid; the capsule is covered with a conical
chimney, made out of a thin sheet of copper, and at the opening at the top

<div class="caption">Fig. 318.—Experiment for turning columbines a green colour with ammoniacal ether.</div>
</div>

<p>M. Filpol, a distinguished <em>savant</em>, has exhibited to the members of the
Scientific Association, Paris, the results which he obtained by subjecting
flowers to the influence of a mixture of sulphuric ether and some drops of
ammonia; he has shown that, under the influence of this liquid, a great
number of violets or roses turn a deep green. We have recently made on
this subject a series of experiments which we will here describe, and which
may be easily attempted by those of our readers who are interested in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
question. Some common ether is poured into a glass, and to it is added a
small quantity of liquid ammonia (about one-tenth of the volume). The
flowers with which it is desired to experiment are then plunged into the
fluid (fig. 318). A number of flowers, whose natural colour is red or violet,
take instantaneously a bright green tint; these are red geranium, violet,
periwinkle, lilac, red and pink roses, wall-flower, thyme, small blue campanula,
fumeter, myosotis, and heliotrope. Other flowers, whose colours are
not of the same shade, take different tints when in contact with ammoniacal
ether. The upper petal of the violet sweet-pea becomes dark blue, whilst
the lower petal turns a bright green colour. The streaked carnation
becomes brown and bright green. White flowers generally turn yellow,
such as the white poppy, the variegated snow-dragon, which becomes yellow
and dark violet, the white rose, which takes a straw colour, white columbine,
camomile, syringa, white daisy, potatoe blossom, white julian, honeysuckle,
and white foxglove, which in contact with ammoniacal ether assume more
or less deep shades of yellow. White snap-dragon becomes yellow and
dark orange. Red geranium turns blue in a very remarkable fashion; with
the monkey-flower the ammoniacal ether only affects the red spots, which
turn a brownish green; red snap-dragon turns a beautiful brown; valerian
takes a shade of grey; and the red corn-poppy assumes a dark violet.
Yellow flowers are not changed by ammoniacal ether; buttercups, marigolds,
and yellow snap-dragon preserve their natural colour. Leaves of a red
colour are instantly turned green when placed in contact with ammoniacal
ether. The action of this liquid is so rapid that it is easy to procure green
spots by pouring here and there a drop of the solution. In like manner
violet flowers, such as periwinkles, can be spotted with white, even without
gathering them. We will complete our remarks on this subject with a
description of experiments performed by M. Gabba in Italy by means of
ammonia acting on flowers. M. Gabba simply used a plate, in which he
poured a certain quantity of solution of ammonia. He placed on the plate
a funnel turned upside down, in the tube of which he arranged the flowers
on which he wished to experiment. He then found that under the influence
of the ammonia the blue, violet, and purple flowers became a beautiful
green, red flowers black, and white yellow, etc.</p>

<p>The most singular changes of colour are shown by flowers which are
composed of different tints, their red streaks turning green, the white yellow,
etc. Another curious example is that of red and white fuchsias, which,
through the action of ammonia, turn yellow, blue, and green. When flowers
have been subjected to these changes of colour, and afterwards plunged into
pure water, they preserve their new tint for several hours, after which they
gradually return to their natural colour. Another interesting observation,
due to M. Gabba, is that asters, which are naturally inodorous, acquire an
agreeable aromatic odour under the influence of ammonia. Asters of a violet
colour become red when wetted with nitric acid mixed with water. On the
other hand, if these same flowers are enclosed in a wooden box, where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
are exposed to the fumes of hydrochloric acid, they become, in six hours’
time, a beautiful red colour, which they preserve when placed in a dry, shady
place, after having been properly dried. Hydrochloric acid has the effect of
making flowers red that have been rendered green by the action of ammonia,
and also alters their appearance very sensibly. We may also mention, in
conclusion, that ammonia, combined with ether, acts much more promptly
than when employed alone.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phosphorescence.</span></p>

<p>Artificial flowers are frequently to be seen prepared in a particular
manner, which have the property of becoming phosphorescent in darkness,
when they have been exposed to the action of a ray of light, solar or electric.
These curious chemical objects are connected with some very interesting
phenomena and remarkable experiments but little known at the present
time, to which we will now draw the reader’s attention.</p>

<p>The faculty possessed by certain bodies of emitting light when placed
in certain conditions, is much more general than is usually supposed.</p>

<p>M. Edmond Becquerel, to whom we owe a remarkable work on this
subject, divides the phenomena of phosphorescence into five distinct classes:</p>

<p>1. <em>Phosphorescence through elevation of temperature.</em> Among the substances
which exhibit this phenomenon in a high degree we may mention
certain diamonds, coloured varieties of fluoride of calcium, some minerals;
and sulphur, known under the name of artificial phosphorus, when it has
previously been exposed to the action of the light.</p>

<p>2. <em>Phosphorescence through mechanical action.</em> This is to be observed
when we rub certain bodies together, or against a hard substance. If we
rub together two quartz crystals in the dark, we perceive red sparks; and
when pounding chalk or sugar, there is also an emission of sparks.</p>

<p>3. <em>Phosphorescence through electricity.</em> This is manifested by the light
accompanying disengagement of electricity, and when gases and rarefied
vapours transmit electric discharges.</p>

<p>4. <em>Spontaneous Phosphorescence</em> is observed, as every one knows, in connection
with several kinds of living creatures,—glow-worms, noctilucids, etc.,
and similar phosphorescent effects are produced also with organic substances,
animal or vegetable, before putrefaction sets in. It is manifested
also at the flowering time of certain plants, etc.</p>

<p>5. <em>Phosphorescence through insolation and the action of light.</em> “It consists,”
says M. Edmond Becquerel, “in exposing for some instants to the action of
the sun, or to that of rays emanating from a powerful luminous source,
certain mineral or organic substances, which immediately become luminous,
and shine in the dark with a light, the colour and brilliancy of which depend
on their nature and physical character; the light gradually diminishes in
intensity during a period varying from some seconds to several hours. When
these substances are exposed anew to the action of light, the same effect is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
reproduced. The intensity of the light emitted after insolation is always
much less than that of the incidental light.” These phenomena appear to
have been first observed with precious stones; then, in 1604, in calcined
Bologna stone, and later, in a diamond by Boyle, in 1663; in 1675 it was
noticed in Baudoin phosphorus (residuum of the calcination of nitrate of lime),
and more recently still in connection with other substances which we will
mention. The substances most powerfully influenced by the action of light
are sulphates of calcium and barium, sulphate of strontium, certain kinds of
diamonds, and that variety of fluoride of calcium, which has received the
name of <em>chlorophane</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_332.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 319.—Artificial flower coated with phosphorescent powder, exposed to the light of magnesium wire.</div>
</div>

<p>Phosphorescent sulphate of calcium is prepared by calcining in an
earthenware crucible a mixture of flowers of sulphur and carbonate of lime.
But the preparation only succeeds with carbonate of lime of a particular
character. That obtained from the calcination of oyster shells produces
very good results. Three parts of this substance is mixed with one part of
flowers of sulphur, and is made red-hot in a crucible covered in from contact
with the air. The substance thus obtained gives, after its insolation, a
yellow light in the dark. The shells of oysters, however, are not always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
pure, and the result is sometimes not very satisfactory; it is therefore better
to make use of some substance whose composition is more to be relied on.</p>

<p>“When we desire to prepare a phosphorescent sulphate with lime, or
carbonate of lime,” says M. E. Becquerel, “the most suitable proportions
are those which in a hundred parts of the substance are composed of eighty
to a hundred of flowers of sulphur in the first case, and forty-eight to a
hundred in the second, that is, when we employ the quantity of sulphur
which will be necessary for burning with carbonate of lime to produce a
monosulphate.<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> It is necessary to have regard to the elevation of the
temperature in the preparation. By using lime procured from arragonite,
and reducing the temperature below five hundred degrees for a sufficient
time for the reaction between the sulphur and lime to take place, the excess
of sulphur is eliminated, and we have a feebly luminous mass, of a bluish
tint; if this mass is raised to a temperature of eight hundred or nine hundred
degrees, it will exhibit a very bright light.”</p>

<p>Sulphate of calcium possesses different phosphorescent properties according
to the nature of the salt which has served to produce the carbonate of
lime employed. If we transform marble into nitrate of lime, by dissolving
it in water and nitric acid, and form a precipitate with carbonate of
ammonium, and use the carbonate of lime thus obtained in the preparation
of sulphate of calcium, we have a product which gives a phosphorescence of
a violet-red colour. If the carbonate of lime used is obtained from chloride
of calcium precipitated by carbonate of ammonia, the phosphorescence is
yellow. If we submit carbonate of lime, prepared with lime water and
carbonic acid, to the influence of sulphur, we obtain a sulphur giving a
phosphorescent light of very pure violet. Carbonate of lime obtained by
forming a precipitate of crystallized chloride of calcium with different
alkaline carbonates also gives satisfactory results.</p>

<p>Luminous sulphates of strontium may be obtained, like those of calcium,
by the action of sulphur on strontia or the carbonate of this base, by the
reduction of sulphates of strontia with charcoal. Blue and green shades
are the most common. Sulphates of barium also present very remarkable
phenomena of phosphorescence; but to obtain very luminous intensity a
higher temperature is needed than with the other substances mentioned, and
we have the same result when we reduce native sulphate of baryta with charcoal;
that is to say, when the reaction takes place which produces the phosphorus
formerly known as <em>phosphorus of Bologna</em>. Preparations obtained from
baryta have a phosphorescence varying from orange-red to green.</p>

<p>The preparation of such substances as we have just enumerated afford
an easy explanation of the method of manufacturing the luminous flowers
which we described at the commencement of this chapter. We obtain
some artificial flowers, cover them with some liquid gum, sprinkle with
phosphorescent sulphur, and let them dry. The pulverulent matter then
adheres to them securely, and it is only necessary to expose the flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
thus prepared to the light of the sun, or the rays emanating from magnesium
wire in a state of combustion (fig. 319), to produce immediate phosphorescent
effects. If taken into a dark room (fig. 320) they shine with great
brilliancy, and give off very exquisite coloured rays. Phosphorescent sulphates
are used also in tracing names or designs on a paper surface, etc., and it
can easily be conceived that such experiments may be infinitely varied
according to the pleasure of the experimenter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 320.—Phosphorescent flower emitting light in a dark room.</div>
</div>

<p>But let us ask ourselves if these substances are not capable of being
put to more serious uses, and of being classed among useful products. To
this we can reply very decidedly in the affirmative. With phosphorescent
matter we can obtain luminous faces for clocks placed in dark, obscure
spots, and it is not impossible to use it for making sign-boards for shops, or
numbers of houses, which can be lit up at night. Professor Norton even
goes so far as to propose in the “Journal of the Franklin Institute,” not
only coating the walls of rooms with these phosphorescent substances, but
also the fronts of houses, when he considers it would be possible to do away
entirely with street lights, the house-fronts absorbing sufficient light during
the day to remain luminous the whole of the night.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chemistry Applied to Sleight of Hand.</span></p>

<p>While physics has provided the species of entertainment called “sleight
of hand” with a number of interesting effects, chemistry has only offered it
very feeble contributions. Robert Houdin formerly made use of electricity
to move the hands of his magic clock, and the electric magnet in making an
iron box so heavy instantaneously that no one could lift it. Robin has
made use of optics to produce the curious spectacle of the decapitated man,
spectres, etc. Those persons who are fond of this kind of amusement may,
however, borrow from chemistry some original experiments, which can be
easily undertaken, and I will conclude this chapter by describing a juggling
feat which I have seen recently executed
before a numerous audience by a very
clever conjuror.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<p>The operator took a glass that was
perfectly transparent, and placed it on a
table, announcing that he should cover the
glass with a saucer, and then, retiring to
some distance, would fill it with the smoke
from a cigarette. And this he carried out
exactly, standing smoking his cigarette in
the background, while the glass, as though
by enchantment, slowly filled with the
fumes of the smoke. This trick is easily
accomplished. It is only necessary to pour
previously into the glass two or three
drops of hydrochloric acid, and to moisten
the bottom of the saucer with a few drops
of ammonia. These two liquids are unperceived
by the spectators, but as soon as
the saucer is placed over the glass, they
unite in forming white fumes of hydrochlorate
of ammonia, which bear a complete resemblance to the smoke of
tobacco.</p>

<p>This experiment excited the greatest astonishment among the spectators
present on the occasion, but understanding something of chemistry
myself, I easily guessed at the solution of the mystery. The same result is
obtained in a course of chemistry in a more simple manner, and without any
attempt at trickery, by placing the opening of a bottle of ammonia against
the opening of another bottle containing hydrochloric acid.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<p class="hang">CHEMISTRY AND ALCHEMY—CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS—THE
ATMOSPHERIC AIR.</p>


<p>We have in the foregoing pages given some experiments, and considered
several of the metals, but there are numerous very interesting
subjects still remaining; indeed, the number is so great that we can
only pick and choose. All people are desirous to hear something of the
atmosphere, of water, and the earth; and as we proceed to speak of
crystals and minerals, and so on to geology, we shall learn a good deal
respecting our globe—its conformation and constituents. But the atmospheric
air must be treated of first. This will lead us to speak of oxygen
and nitrogen. Water will serve to introduce hydrogen with a few experiments,
and thus we shall have covered a good deal of ground on our way
towards various other elements in daily use and appreciation. Now let us
begin with a few words concerning <span class="smcap">Chemistry</span> itself.</p>

<p>At the very outset we are obliged to grope in the dark after the
origin of this fascinating science. Shem, or “Chem,” the son of Noah, has
been credited with its introduction, and, at any rate, magicians were in
Egypt in the time of Moses, and the lawgiver is stated by ancient writers
to have gained his knowledge from the Egyptians. But we need not
pursue that line of argument. In more modern times the search for the
Philosopher’s Stone and the Elixir of Life, which respectively turned
everything to gold, and bestowed long life upon the fortunate finder,
occupied many people, who in their researches no doubt discovered the
germs of the popular science of Chemistry in Alchemy, while the pursuit
took a firm hold of the popular imagination for centuries; and even now
chemistry is the most favoured science, because of its adaptability to all
minds, for it holds plain and simple truths for our every-day experience to
confirm, while it leads us step by step into the infinite, pleasing us with
experiments as we proceed.</p>

<p>Alchemy was practised by numerous quacks in ancient times and the
Middle Ages, but all its professors were not quacks. Astrology and alchemy
were associated by the Arabians. Geber was a philosopher who devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
himself entirely to alchemy, and who lived in the year 730 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> He
fancied gold would cure all disease, and he did actually discover corrosive
sublimate, nitric acid, and nitrate of silver. To give even a list of the noted
alchemists and magicians would fill too much space. Raymond Sully,
Paracelsus, Friar Bacon, Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Flamel, Bernard
of Treves, Doctor Dee, with his assistant Kelly, and in later times Jean
Delisle, and Joseph Balsamo (Cagliostro), who was one of the most notorious
persons in Europe about one hundred years ago (1765-1789), are names
taken at random; and with the older philosophers chemistry was an all-absorbing
occupation—not for gold, but knowledge.</p>

<p>The revelation was slow. On the temperature of bodies the old arts
of healing were based—for chemistry and medicine were allies. The elements,
we read, existed on the supposition “that bodies were hot or cold, dry or
moist”; and on this distinction for a long time “was based the practice of
medicine.” The doctrine of the “three principles” of existence superseded
this,—the principles being salt, mercury, and sulphur. Metals had been
regarded as living bodies, gases as souls or spirits. The idea remained
that the <em>form</em> of the substance gave it its character. Acid was pointed;
sweet things were round.</p>

<p>Chemistry, then, has had a great deal to contend against. From the
time of the Egyptians and Chinese, who were evidently acquainted with
various processes,—dyeing, etc.,—the science filtered through the alchemists
to Beecher and Stahl, and then the principle of affinity—a disposition to
combine—was promulgated, supplemented in 1674 by Mayow, by the theory
of divorce or analysis. He concluded that where union could be effected,
separation was equally possible. In 1718 the first “Table of Affinities”
was produced. Affinity had been shown to be <em>elective</em>, for Mayow pointed
out that fixed salts chose one acid rather than another. Richter and Dalton
made great advances. Before them Hales, Black, Priestley, Scheele, Lavoisier,
and numerous others penetrated the mysteries of the science whose
history has been pleasantly written by more than one author who we have
not been able to consult, and have no space to do more than indicate.
In later days Faraday, De la Rive, Roscoe, and many others have rendered
chemistry much more popular, while they have added to its treasures. The
story of the progress of chemistry would fill a large volume, and we have
regretfully to put aside the introduction and pass on.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to investigate the elements, a few words concerning
the general terms used in chemistry will be beneficial to the reader.
If we look at the list of the elements, pp. 308-9, we shall see various
terminations. Some are apparently named from places, some from their
characteristics. Metals lately discovered by the spectroscope (and recently)
end in <em>ium</em>; some end in “ine,” some in “on.” As far as possible in late
years a certain system of nomenclature has been adhered to, but the old
popular names have not been interfered with.</p>

<p>When elements combine together in certain proportions of each they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
receive certain names. The following table will explain the terms used ; for
instance, we find that—</p>

<p>The above examples refer to the union in single proportion of each,
and are called Binary Compounds. When more than one atom of each
element exists in different proportions we have different terms to express such
union. If one atom of oxygen be in the compound it is called a “monoxide”
or “protoxide”; two atoms of oxygen in combination is termed “dioxide”
or “binoxide”; three, “trioxide,” or “tritoxide”; four is the “tetroxide”
or “per-oxide,” etc. When more than one atom, but not two atoms is
involved, we speak of the <em>sesqui</em>-oxide (one-and-a-half),—“oxide” being
interchangeable for “sulphide” or “chloride,” according to the element.</p>

<p>There are other distinctions adopted when metals form two series of
combinations, such as <em>ous</em> and <em>ic</em>, which apply, as will be seen, to acids.
Sulphur<em>ic</em> and sulphur<em>ous</em> acids, nitr<em>ic</em> and nitr<em>ous</em> acid are familiar examples.
In these cases we shall find that in the acids ending in “ous” oxygen
is present in less quantity than in the acids ending in <em>ic</em>. The symbolic
form will prove this directly, the number of atoms of oxygen being written
below,</p>

<blockquote><p>
<small>Sulphurous Acid = H<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>3</sub><br />
Nitrous Acid = HNO<sub>2</sub>.<br />
Sulphuric Acid = H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.<br />
Nitric Acid = HNO<sub>3</sub>.<br /></small>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Whenever a stronger compound of oxygen is discovered than that
denominated by <em>ic</em>, chemists adopt the plan of dubbing it the <em>per</em> (ὑπέρ over),
as per-chloric acid, which possesses four atoms of oxygen (HClO<sub>4</sub>), chloric
acid being HClO<sub>3</sub>. The opposite Greek term, ὑπὸ (<em>hupo</em>, below), is used for
an acid with less than two atoms of oxygen, and in books is written “hypo”-chlorous
(for instance). Care has been taken to distinguish between the
higher and lower; for “<em>hyper</em>” is used in English to denote excess, as
hyper-critical; and <em>hypo</em> might to a reader unacquainted with the derivation
convey just the opposite meaning to what is intended.</p>

<p>While speaking of these terminations we may show how these distinctive
endings are carried out. We shall find, if we pursue the subject, that when
wehave a salt of any acid ending in <em>ic</em> the salt terminates in “<em>ate</em>.” Similarly
the salts of acids ending in <em>ous</em>, end in “<em>ite</em>.” To continue the same
example we have—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<small>Sulphur<em>ous</em> Acid, which forms salts called Sulph<em>ites</em>.<br />
Sulphur<em>ic</em> Acid, which forms salts called Sulph<em>ates</em></small>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Besides these are sulph<em>ides</em>, which are results of the unions or com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>pounds
of elementary bodies. Sulph<em>ites</em> are more complicated unions of the
compounds. Sulphates are the salts formed by the union of sulphuric acid
with bases. Sulphides or sulphurets are compounds in which sulphur forms
the electro-negative element, and sulphites are salts formed by the union of
sulphur<em>ous</em> acids with bases, or by their action upon them.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 322.—Combinations of elements.</div>
</div>

<p>The symbolical nomenclature of the chemist is worse than Greek to
the uninitiated. We frequently see in so-called popular chemical books a
number of hieroglyphics and combinations of letters with figures very difficult
to decipher, much less to interpret. These symbols take the place of the
names of the chemical compounds. Thus water is made up of oxygen and
hydrogen in certain proportions; that is, two of hydrogen to one of oxygen.
The symbolic reading is simple, H<sub>2</sub>O, = the oxide of hydrogen. Potassium
again mingles with oxygen. Potassium is K in our list; KO is oxide of
potassium (potash). Let us look into this a little closer.</p>

<p>The union of one particle of a simple body with a particle of another
simple body can be easily understood; but, as we have seen, it is possible to
have substances consisting of four or five different particles, though the
greater number of chemical combinations consist of two or three dissimilar
ones. In the diagram (fig. 322) we have some possible combinations.</p>

<p>In these combinations we may have one particle of <i>a</i> in combination
with one, two, three, four, or five of <i>b</i>, and many particles of <i>a</i> can unite with
various molecules of <i>b</i>. Suppose we have oxygen and sulphur compounds
as follows:—</p>

<p>Thus there are three different compounds of these two elements—SO,
SO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>3</sub> (without water).</p>


<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_339a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 323.-(1) Hydrosulphurous Acid. (2) Sulphurous Acid. (3) Sulphuric Acid.</div>
</div>

<p>A compound body may combine with another compound body, and
this makes a complicated compound. Suppose we have a mixture of sulphuric
acid and potash. We have a sulphate of potassium (K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and combinations
of these combinations may likewise be formed. We must read these symbols
by the light of the combining weights given in the table, and then we shall find
the weight of oxygen or other elements in combination. Thus when we see
a certain symbol (Hg.S for instance), we understand that they form a compound
including so many parts of mercury and so many of sulphur, which is
known as vermilion. Hg.O is oxide of mercury, and by reference to the
table of Atomic Weights, we find mercury is Hg., and its combining weight is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
200; while oxygen is O, and its weight is 16. Thus we see at once
how much of each element is contained in oxide of mercury, and this proportion
never varies; there must be 200 of one and 16 of the other, by
weight, to produce the oxide. So if the oxygen has to be separated from it,
the sum of 216 parts must be taken to procure the 16 parts of oxygen.
When we see, as above, O<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub>, we know that the weight must be calculated
twice or three times, O being 16; O<sub>2</sub> is therefore 32 parts by weight.
So when we have found what the compounds consist of, we can write
them symbolically with ease.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Composition of the Atmospheric Air.</span></p>

<p>We have already communicated a variety of facts concerning the air.
We have seen that it possesses pressure and weight. We call the gaseous
envelope of the earth the atmosphere, and we are justified in concluding that
other planets possess an atmosphere also, though of a different nature to ours.
We have seen how easy it is to weigh the air, but we may repeat the experiment.
(<i>See</i> illustration, fig. 45, <a href="#Page_50">page 50</a>.) We shall find that a perfectly empty
glass globe will balance the weights in the scale-pan; admit the air, and the
glass globe will sink. So air possesses weight. We have mentioned the
Magdeburg hemispheres, the barometer, the air-pump, and the height and
the pressure of the atmosphere have been indicated. The density of the
atmosphere decreases as we ascend; for the first seven miles the density
diminishes one-fourth that of the air at the sea-level, and so on for every
succeeding seven.</p>

<p>In consequence of the equal, if enormous, pressure exercised in every
direction, we do not perceive the inconvenience, but if the air were removed
from inside of a drum, the parchment would quickly collapse. We feel the
air when we move rapidly. We breathe the air, and that statement brings
us to consider the composition of the atmosphere, which, <em>chemically</em> speaking,
<em>may vary a little</em> (as compared with the whole mass) in consequence of changes
which are continually taking place, but to all intents and purposes the air is
composed as follows, in 100 parts:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="smaltab" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td align="left">Nitrogen</td>
  <td align="left">79 parts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">Oxygen</td>
  <td align="left">20 parts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">Carbonic Acid &nbsp; </td>
  <td align="left">04 parts.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>with minute quantities of other ingredients, such as ammonia, iodine,
carbonetted hydrogen, hydrochloric acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, nitric acid,
carbonic oxide, and dust particles, as visible in the sunbeams, added.</p>

<p>The true composition of the atmosphere was not known till Lavoisier
demonstrated that it consisted of two gases, one of which was the vital fluid,
or oxygen, discovered by Priestley. To the other gas Lavoisier gave the name
of Azote,—an enemy of life,—because it caused death if inhaled alone. The
carbonic acid in the air varies very much, and in close, heated, and crowded
rooms increases to a large quantity, which causes lassitude and headache.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>

<p>We can easily prove the existence of carbonic acid gas as exhaled from
the lungs. Suppose we take a glass and fill it partly with clear lime-water;
breathe through a glass tube into the water in the glass, and very quickly
you will perceive that the lime-water is becoming cloudy and turbid. This
cloudiness is due to the presence of chalk, which has been produced by the
action of the carbonic acid gas in the lime-water. This is a well known and
always interesting experiment, because it leads up to the vital question of
our existence, and the functions of breathing and living.</p>

<p>A popular writer once wrote a book entitled, “Is Life Worth Living?”
and a witty commentator replied to the implied question by saying, “It
depends upon the <em>liver</em>.” This was felt to be true by many people who
suffer, but the scientific man will go farther, and tell you it depends upon the
air you breathe, and on the carbonic acid you can raise to create heat,—animal
heat,—which is so essential to our well-being. We are always burning;
a furnace is within us, never ceasing to burn without visible combustion. We
are generating heat by means of the blood. We know that we inhale air into
the lungs, and probably are aware that the air so received parts with the
oxygen to renew the blood. The nitrogen dilutes the oxygen, for if we
inhaled a less-mixed air we should either be burnt up or become lunatics, as
light-headed as when inhaling “laughing-gas.” This beautifully graduated
mixture is taken into our bodies, the oxygen renews the blood and gives it
its bright red colour; the carbon which exists in all our bodies is cold and
dead when not so vivified by oxygen. The carbonic acid given off produces
heat, and our bodies are warm. But when the action ceases we become cold,
we die away, and cease to live. Man’s life exemplifies a taper burning;
the carbon waste is consumed as the wax is, and when the candle burns
away—it dies! It is a beautiful study, full of suggestiveness to all who care to
study the great facts of Nature, which works by the same means in all
matter. We will refer to plants presently, after having proved by experiment
the existence of nitrogen in the air.</p>

<p>Rutherford experimented very cruelly upon a bird, which he placed
beneath a glass shade, and there let it remain in the carbonic acid exhaled
from its lungs, till the oxygen being at length all consumed by the bird, it
died. When the atmosphere had been chemically purified by a solution
of caustic potash, another bird was introduced, but though it lived for some
time, it did not exist so long as the first. Again the air was deprived of
the carbonic acid, and a third bird was introduced. The experiment was
thus repeated, till at length a bird was placed beneath the receiver, and it
perished at once. This is at once a cruel and clumsy method of making
an experiment, which can be more pleasantly and satisfactorily practised by
burning some substance in the air beneath the glass. Phosphorus, having
a great affinity for oxygen, is usually chosen. The experiment can be
performed as follows with a taper, but the phosphorus is a better exponent.</p>

<p>Let us take a shallow basin with some water in it, a cork or small
plate floating upon the water, and in the plate a piece of phosphorus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
We must be careful how we handle phosphorus, for it has a habit, well
known, but sometimes forgotten by amateur chemists, of suddenly taking
fire. Light this piece of phosphorus,—a small piece will do if the jar be
of average “shade” size,—and place the glass over it, as in the illustration
(fig. 325). The smoke will quickly spread in the jar, and the entry of air
being prevented, because the jar is resting under water, phosphoric acid will
be formed, and the oxygen thereby consumed. The water, meanwhile, will
rise in the jar, the pressure of the air being removed. The burning
phosphorus will soon go out, and when the glass is cool, you will be
able to ascertain what is inside the jar. Put a lighted taper underneath,
and it will go out. The taper would not go out before the phosphorus
was burnt in the glass, and so now we perceive we have azote in the
receptacle—that is, nitrogen. The other, the constituent of our atmosphere,
carbonic acid, as we have seen, is very injurious to the life of animals, and
as every animal breathes it out into the air, what becomes of it? Where
does all this enormous volume of carbonic acid, the quantities of this poison
which are daily and nightly exhaled, where do they all go to? We may
be sure nature has provided for the safe disposal of it all. Not only
because we live and move about still,—and of course that is a proof,—but
because nature always has a compensating law. Remember <em>nothing is
wasted</em>; not even the refuse, poisonous air we get rid of from our lungs.
Where does it go?</p>

<p>It goes to nourish the plants and trees and vegetables that we delight
to look upon and to eat the fruit of. Thus the vegetable world forms a
link between the animals and the minerals. Vegetables obtain food, so to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
speak, and nourishment from water, ammonia, and carbonic acid, all
compound bodies, but inorganic.</p>

<p>Water consists of oxygen and hydrogen, carbonic acid of carbon and
oxygen, and ammonia of hydrogen and nitrogen. Water and ammonia
are present in the air; so are oxygen and nitrogen. Water falls in the
form of rain, dew, etc. So in the atmosphere around us we find nearly
every necessary for plant-life; and in the ground, which supplies some
metallic oxides for their use, we find the remainder. From the air, then, the
plant derives its life.</p>

<p>The vegetable kingdom in turn gives all animals their food. This
you will see at a glance is true. Certainly animals live on animals. Man
and wilder animals live on the beasts of the field in a measure, but those
beasts derive their nourishment from vegetables—the vegetable kingdom.
So we live on the vegetable kingdom, and it separates the carbonic acid
from the air, and absorbs it. What we do not want it takes. What we
want it gives. Vegetables give out oxygen, and we consume it gladly.
We throw away carbonic acid, and the plants take it greedily; and thus
the atmosphere is retained pure for our use. We can, if desirable, prove
that plants absorb carbonic acid and give out oxygen by placing leaves
of a plant in water, holding the acid in solution, and let the sun shine upon
them. Before long we shall find that the carbonic acid has disappeared,
and that oxygen has come into the water.</p>

<p>Carbonic acid is sufficiently heavy to be poured from one vessel to
another; and if we have obtained some in a glass, we can extinguish a
taper by pouring the invisible gas on to the lighted taper, when it will be
immediately extinguished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p>From the foregoing observations it will be perceived how very desirable
it is that ventilation should be attended to. People close up windows and
doors and fireplaces, and go to bed and sleep.  In the morning they complain
of headache and lassitude; they wonder what is the matter, and why
the children are not well. Simply because they have been rebreathing
the carbonic acid. Go into a closed railway carriage which is nearly filled
(and it is astonishing to us how people can be so foolish as to close every
outlet), and you will recoil in disgust. These travellers shut the ventilators
and windows “because of the cold.” A very small aperture will ventilate
a railway carriage; but a close carriage is sickening and enervating, as
these kind of travellers find out by the time they reach their journey’s end.
Air was given us to breathe at night as well as by day; and though from
man’s acts or omissions there may be circumstances in which “night” air
may affect the health, we maintain that air is no more injurious naturally
than “day” air. Colder it may be, but any air at night is “night” air,
in or out of doors at night; and we are certain that night air in itself
never hurt any healthy person. It is not nature’s plan to destroy, but to
save. If a person delicate in constitution gets hot, and comes out into a
colder atmosphere, and defy nature in that way, he (or she) must take the
consequences. But air and <em>ventilation</em> (not draught) are necessaries of
health, and to say they injure is to accuse nature falsely. There are many
impurities in the air in cities, and in country places sometimes, but such
impurities are owing to man’s acts and omissions. With average sanitary
arrangements and appliances in a neighbourhood no one need be afraid to
breathe fresh air night or day; and while many invalids have, we believe,
been retarded in recovery from being kept in a close room, hundreds will
be benefited by plenty of fresh air. We should not so insist upon these
plain and simple truths were there not so many individuals who think it
beneficial to close up every avenue by which air can enter, and who then
feel ill and out of spirits, blaming everything but their own short-sightedness
for the effect of their own acts. An inch or two of a window may be open at
night in a room, as the chimney register should be always fully up in bedrooms.
When there are fires the draught supplies fresh air to the room with
sufficient rapidity. But many seaside journeys might be avoided if fresh air
were insisted on at home.</p>

<p>There is another and an important constituent of the atmosphere called
<span class="smcap">Ozone</span>, which is very superior oxygen, or oxygen in what is termed the
“Allotropic” state, and is distantly related to electricity, inasmuch as it can be
produced by an electrical discharge. This partly accounts for the freshness
in the air after a thunderstorm, for we are all conscious that the storm has
“cleared the air.” The fresh, crisp ozone in the atmosphere is evident.
Ozone differs from oxygen in possessing taste and smell, and it is heavier
by one-half than the oxygen gas. There is a good deal of ozone in the sea
breeze, and we can, though not infallibly, detect its presence by test-paper
prepared with iodide of potassium, which, when ozone is present, will turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
blue. We have still something to learn about ozone, which may be considered
as “condensed oxygen.”</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 326.  &nbsp;     Development of gas by combustion.  &nbsp;  Fig. 327.</div>
</div>

<p>We have frequently mentioned “combustion,” and as under ordinary
circumstances such effects cannot take place without atmospheric air, we will
consider it. Combustion is chemical action accompanied by light and heat.
Chemical union is always attended by the development of heat, not always
by light, because the union varies in intensity and quickness. But when a
candle is burning we can study all the interesting phenomena of combustion.
We have already spoken of <span class="smcap">Heat</span>
and <span class="smcap">Light</span>, so we need only refer
the readers to those subjects in the
former parts of this volume. Heat
is referable to chemical action, and
varies according to the energy of
union. Heat is always present, remember,
in a greater or less degree;
and when visible combustion takes
place we see light. Invisible combustion
goes on in our bodies, and
we feel heat; when we get cold we
feed the fire by eating, or blow it
by exercise and air in our lungs.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_345b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 328.—Gas evolved from flame.</div>
</div>

<p>We shall speak, however, of
combustion now as it affects us in daily life; our fires, our candles, gas, etc.,
and under these ordinary circumstances hydrogen and carbon are present.
(We shall hear more about carbon presently.) These unite with the oxygen
to form water and carbonic acid; the water being visible as we first put the
cold shade upon the lighted lamp, and the carbonic acid renders the air impure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>In the case of a common candle, or lamp, combustion takes place in
the same way. The wick is the intermediary. The oil mounts in the lamp
wick, where it is converted into a gas by heat; it then “takes fire,” and
gives us light and heat. The candle-flame is just the same with one exception:
the burning material is solid, not liquid, though the difference is only
apparent, for the wax is melted and goes up as gas. The burning part
of the wick has a centre where there is no combustion, and contains carbon.
We can prove this by placing a bent tube, as in the illustration (fig. 326),
one end in the unburning part of the flame. We shall soon see a dark vapour
come over into the receiver. This is combustible, for if we raise the tube
without the glass we can light the gas (fig. 327). If we insert the end of
the tube into the brilliant portion of the flame we shall perceive a black
vapour, which will extinguish the combustion, for it is a mixture of carbonic
acid gas and aqueous vapour, in which (fig. 328) particles of carbon are
floating.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 330.—Davy lamp (section).</p></div>
</div></div>

<p>When we proceed to light our lamps to read or to write by, we find
some difficulty in making the wick burn at first. We present to it a lighted
taper, and it has no immediate effect. Here we have oil and cotton, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
things which would speedily set a warehouse in flames from top to bottom,
but we cannot even ignite them, try all we can. Why?—Because we must
first obtain a gas, oil will not burn liquid; it must be heated to a gaseous
point before it will burn, as all combustion depends upon that,—so flames
mount high in air. Now in a candle-flame, as will be seen in the diagram
(fig. 331.), there are three portions,—the inner dark core, which
consists of unburnt gas; the outer flame, which gives light; and
the outside rim of perfect combustion non-luminous. In the
centre, A, there is no heat. If we place a piece of gauze wire
over the flame at a little distance the flame will not penetrate it.
It will remain underneath, because the wire, being of metal,
quickly absorbs the heat, and consequently there is no flame.
This idea led to the invention of the “safety” lamp by Sir
Humphrey Davy, which, although it is not infallible, is the
only lamp in general use in mines (figs. 329, 330).</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_347a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 331.—Construction of a candle flame.</div>
</div>

<p>Mines must have light, but there is a gas in mines, a “marsh”
gas, which becomes very explosive when it mixes with oxygen.
Of course the gas will be harmless till it meets oxygen, but, in
its efforts to meet, it explodes the moment the union takes place; instead
of burning slowly like a candle it goes off all at once. This gas, called
“fire damp,” is carburetted hydrogen, and when it explodes it develops into
carbonic acid gas, which suffocates the miners.</p>

<small>NON-METALLIC ELEMENTS</small>.</h2>

<p class="center"><small>OXYGEN—SYMBOL <b>O</b>; ATOMIC WEIGHT 16.</small></p>


<p>Oxygen is certainly the most abundant element in nature. It exists all
around us, and the animal and vegetable worlds are dependent upon it. It
constitutes in combination about one-half of the crust of the earth, and
composes eight-ninths of its weight of water. It is a gas without taste or
colour. Oxygen was discovered by Priestley and Scheele, in 1774,
independently of each other.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_348.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 333.—Oxygen from oxide of mercury.</div>
</div>

<p>Oxygen can be procured from the oxides of the metals, particularly
from gold, silver, and platinum. The noble metals are reducible from their
oxides by heat, and this fact assists us at once. If we heat chlorate of
potash, mixed with binoxide of manganese, in a retort in a furnace, the gas
will be given off. There are many other ways of obtaining oxygen, and
we illustrate two (figs. 333, 335).</p>

<p>The red oxide of mercury will very readily evolve oxygen, and if
we heat a small quantity of the compound in a retort as per illustration
(fig. 333) we shall get the gas. In a basin of water we place a tube test-glass,
and the gas from the retort will pass over and collect in the test tube,
driving out the water.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_349a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 334.—Showing retort placed in furnace.</div>
</div>

<p>The other method mentioned above,—viz., by heating chlorate of potash,
etc., in a furnace, is shown in the following illustration. Oxygen, as we
have said, is a colourless and inodorous gas, and for a long time it could not
be obtained in any other form; but lately both oxygen and hydrogen have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
been liquified under tremendous pressure at a very low temperature.
Oxygen causes any red-hot substance plunged into it to burn brightly; a
match will readily inflame if a spark be
remaining, while phosphorus is exceedingly
brilliant, and these appearances, with many
others equally striking, are caused by the
affinity for those substances possessed by
the gas. Combustion is merely oxidation,
just as the process of rusting is, only in the
latter case the action is so slow that no
sensible heat is produced. But when an
aggregate of slowly oxidising masses are heaped together, heat is generated,
and at length bursts into flame. This phenomenon is called “spontaneous
combustion.” Cases have been known in which the gases developed
in the human body by the abuse of alcoholic drinks have ended fatally;
in like manner the body being completely charred. (Combustion must
not be confounded with <em>ignition</em>, as in the electric light.) Oxygen then,
we see, is a great supporter of combustion, though not a combustible itself
as coal is. When the chemical union of oxygen with another substance
is very rapid an explosion takes place.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_349b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 335.—The generation of oxygen from oxide of manganese and potash.</div>
</div>

<p>Oxidation occurs in various ways. Besides those already mentioned,
all verdigris produced on copper, all decays of whatever kind, disintegration,
and respiration, are the effects of oxygen. The following experiment for the
extraction of oxygen directly from the air was made by M. Boussingault,
who passed the gas upon a substance at a certain temperature, and released
it at a higher. The illustration on page 351 will show the way in which
the experiment was performed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>Boussingault permitted a thin stream of water to flow into a large
empty flask, and by this water the air was gradually driven out into a flask
containing chloride of calcium and sulphuric acid,
which effectually dried it. This dry air then
passed into a large tube inside the reverberatory
furnace, in which tube were pieces of caustic
baryta. Heated to a dull redness this absorbs
oxygen, and when the heat is increased to a
bright red the superabundant gas is given off.
Thus the oxygen was permitted to pass from
the furnace-tube into the receiving glass, and
so pure oxygen was obtained from the air
which had been in the glass bottle at first
(fig. 338).</p>

<p class="center"><small>HYDROGEN—SYMBOL <b>H</b>; ATOMIC WEIGHT 1.</small></p>

<p>Hydrogen is abundant in nature, but never free. United with oxygen
it forms water, hence its name, “water-former.” It is to Parcelcus that its
discovery is due, for he found that oil of vitriol in contact with iron
disengaged a gas which was a constituent of water. This gas was
subsequently found to be inflammable, but it is to Cavendish that the real
explanation of hydrogen is owing. He explained his views in 1766.</p>

<p>Hydrogen is obtained in the manner illustrated in the cut, by means
of a furnace, as in fig. 339, or by the bottle method, as per fig. 340. The
first method is less convenient than the second. A gun-barrel or fire-proof
tube is passed through the furnace, and filled
with iron nails or filings; a delivery tube is
at the farther end, and a flask of water boiling
at the other. The oxygen combines with the
iron in the tube, and the hydrogen passes
over. The second method is easily arranged.
A flask, as in the cut, is provided, and in it
some zinc shavings are put. Diluted sulphuric
acid is then poured upon the metal.
Sulphate of zinc is formed in the flask, and
the hydrogen passes off.</p>

<p>Hydrogen being the lightest of all known
bodies, its weight is put as 1, and thus we are
relatively with it enabled to write down the
weights of all the other elements. Hydrogen
is fourteen-and-a-half times lighter than atmospheric air, and would do
admirably for the inflation of balloons were it not so expensive to procure
in such large quantities as would be necessary. Ordinary coal gas, however,
contains a great deal of hydrogen, and answers the same purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>A very pretty experiment may be made with a bladder full of hydrogen
gas. If a tube be fitted to the bladder already provided with a stop-cock,
and a basin of ordinary soap-suds be at hand, by dipping the end of the
tube in the solution and gently expressing the gas, bubbles will be formed
which are of exceeding lightness (fig. 341). They can also be fired with a
taper.</p>

<p>Another experiment may be made with hydrogen as follows:—If we
permit the gas to escape from the flask, and light it, as in the illustration, and
put a glass over it, we shall obtain a musical note, higher or lower, according
to the length, breadth, and thickness of the open glass-tube (fig. 342). If
a number of different tubes be employed, we can obtain a musical instrument—a
gas harmonium.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 338.—Extraction of oxygen from air.</div>
</div>

<p>Hydrogen burns with a blue flame, and is very inflammable. Even
water sprinkled upon a fire will increase its fierceness, because the hydrogen
burns with great heat, and the oxygen is liberated. Being very light, H
can be transferred from one vessel to another if both be held upside down.
Some mixtures of H and O are very explosive. The oxyhydrogen blow-pipe
is used with a mixture of O and H, which is forcibly blown through a tube
and then ignited. The flame thus produced has a most intense heating-power.</p>

<p>A very easy method of producing hydrogen is to put a piece of sodium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
into an inverted cylinder full of water, standing in a basin of water. The
sodium liberates the hydrogen by removing the oxygen from the liquid.</p>


<p class="center"><small>WATER—SYMBOL <b>H<sub>2</sub>O</b>; ATOMIC WEIGHT 18.</small></p>

<p>At page 59 of this volume we said something about water, and remarked
(as we have since perceived by experiment) that “water is composed of
oxygen and hydrogen in proportions, by weight, of eight of the former to
one of the latter gas; in volume, hydrogen is two to one”; and we saw
that “volume and weight were very different things.” This we will do well
to bear in mind, and that, to quote Professor Roscoe, “Water is always made
up of sixteen parts of oxygen to two parts of hydrogen by weight”; sixteen
and two being eighteen, the combining weight of water is eighteen.</p>

</div>

<p>We can prove by the Eudiometer that hydrogen when burnt with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
oxygen forms water; and here we must remark that water is not a mere
mechanical mixture of gases, as air is. Water is the product of chemical
combination, and as we have before said, is really an oxide of hydrogen, and
therefore combustion, or electricity, must be called to our assistance before
we can form water, which is the result of an explosion, the mixture meeting
with an ignited body—the aqueous vapour being expanded by heat.</p>

<p>The ancients supposed water to be a simple body, but Lavoisier and
Cavendish demonstrated its true character. Pure water, at ordinary temperatures,
is devoid of taste and smell, and is a transparent, nearly colourless,
liquid. When viewed in masses it is blue, as visible in a marked degree in
the Rhone and Rhine, at Geneva, and Bâle respectively. Its specific gravity
is 1, and it is taken as the standard for Sp. Gravity, as hydrogen is taken
as the standard for Atomic Weight. The uses of water and the very important
part it plays in the arrangements of nature as a mechanical agent,
geology can attest, and meteorology confirm. It composes the greater
portions of animals and plants; without water the world would be a desert—a
dead planet.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 341.—Blowing bubbles with hydrogen gas.</div>
</div>

<p>We sometimes speak of “pure” spring water, but such a fluid
absolutely pure can scarcely be obtained; and though we can filter water
there will always remain some foreign substance or substances in solution.
It is well known that the action of water wears away and rounds off hard
rocks, and this power of disintegration is supplemented by its strength as a
solvent, which is very great. Rain-water is purest in the country as it falls
from the clouds. In smoky towns it becomes sooty and dirty. It is owing
to the solvent properties of water, therefore, that we have such difficulty in
obtaining a pure supply. There is <em>hard</em> water and <em>soft</em> water. The former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
is derived from the calcareous formations, and contains lime, like the Kent
water. This can be ascertained by noticing the incrustations of the vessels
wherein the water is boiled. But water rising from hard rocks, such as
granite, can do little to disintegrate them at the moment, and therefore the
water rises purer. Springs from a great depth are warm, and are known as
“thermal springs”; and when they come in contact with carbonic acid and
some salts in their passage to the surface, they are known as “mineral waters.”
These waters hold in solution salts of lime and magnesia, or carbonates of
soda with those of lime and magnesia; salts of iron, and compounds of
iodine and bromine are found in the natural mineral waters also, as well as
sulphurous impregnations, instances of which will occur to every reader.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 343.—The composition of water.</div>
</div></div>

<p>We mentioned the Eudiometer just now, and we give an illustration of
it. This instrument is used to ascertain the proportions in which the
elements of water are composed by <em>synthesis</em>, or a putting together of the
constituents of a body to make it up. This is distinguished from <em>analysis</em>,
which means separating the compound body into its elements, as we do
when we pass the electric current through water.</p>

<p>The Eudiometer consists of a stout glass tube sealed hermetically at
one end; two platinum wires are pushed in through the glass just before
the end is sealed. The tube is now filled with mercury, and inverted in a
bowl of the same metal. Hydrogen, and then oxygen, are admitted through
the mercury in the recognised proportions of two to one. By the time the
mercury is somewhat more than half displaced, the tube should be held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
upon a sheet of india-rubber at the bottom of the vessel to keep the metal
in the tube, for when the necessary explosion takes place the mercury might
also be driven out. A spark from the electrophorus or from a Leyden jar
may now be passed through the gases in the tube. The explosion occurs,
and water is formed inside. If the mercury be again admitted it will rise
nearly to the very top of the tube, driving the bubble up. Thus we find
we have formed water from the two gases.</p>

<p>The decomposition of water is easily affected by electricity, and if a
little sulphuric acid be added to the water, the experiment will be thereby
facilitated. Two wires from a battery should be inserted through a glass filled
with the water, and into two test tubes also filled. The wires terminate in
platinum strips, and are fastened at the other end to the positive and
negative poles of the galvanic battery. The gases will collect in the test
tubes, and will be found in proper proportions when the current passes.</p>

<p>So much for water in its liquid state. The solid condition of water
(ice) is equally interesting. When we apply heat to water, we get a vapour
called “steam”; when we cool water to 32° Fahr., we get a solid mass which
weighs just the same as the liquid we have congealed, or the steam we
have raised from an equal amount of water. But water expands while in
the process of solidification, just as it does when it becomes gaseous, and as
we have remarked before, our water-pipes bear full testimony to this scientific
fact. When ice forms it has a tendency to crystallize, and some of these
ice crystals are, as we see, very beautiful. Snow is only water in a nearly
solid form, and the crystals are extremely elegant, appearing more like
flowers than congealed water, in tiny six-pointed ice crystals. Many
philosophers of late years have written concerning these tiny crystals, which,
in common with all crystals, have their own certain form, from which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
never depart. Snowflakes are regular six-sided prisms grouped around a
centre forming angles of 60° and 120°. There are a number of forms, as will
be seen from the accompanying illustrations, and at least ninety-six varieties
have been observed. One snowflake, apparently so like all other flakes that
fall, can thus be viewed with much interest, and yet, while so very various,
snowflakes never get away from their proper hexagonal structure. It has been
remarked that snowflakes falling at the same time have generally the same
form.</p>

<p>Of the latent heat of ice, etc., we have already spoken in our article
upon Heat, and therefore it will be sufficient to state that the latent heat of
water is 79 thermal units, because when passing from the liquid to the
solid state a certain amount of water absorbs sufficient heat to raise
an equal quantity of the liquid 79°. This can be proved by taking
a measured quantity (say a pint) of water at 79° and adding ice of the
same weight to the water. The mixture will be found to be at zero.
Therefore the ice has absorbed or rendered latent 79° of heat which the
water possessed. If we melt ice until only a trace of it is left, we shall still
find the water as cold as the ice was; all the latent heat is employed in
melting the ice. So it will take as much heat to bring a pound of ice at
zero to a pound of water at zero, as it would to raise 79 pounds of water
1°. The same law applies to steam.</p>

<p>Water can be distilled in small quantities by an apparatus, as figured
in the illustration, and by these means we get rid of all impurities which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
inseparable from the liquid otherwise. When it is desirable to distil large
quantities of water a larger apparatus is used, called an “Alembic.” The
principle is simply to convert the liquid by heat into vapour, then cool it,
by condensation, in another vessel.</p>

<p>Rain-water is the purest, as we have said, because it goes through the
process of distillation by nature. The sun takes it up, by evaporation, into
the air, where it is condensed, and falls as rain-water. Water containing
carbonate of lime will petrify or harden, as in stalactite caverns. The carbonic
acid escapes from the dripping water, the carbonate in solution is
deposited as a stalactite, and finally forms pillars in the cave. Sea-water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
contains many salts; its composition is as follows, according to Dr. Schwertzer,
of Brighton:—</p>

<p>There is much more oxygen in water than in air, as can be ascertained
by analysis of these compounds. This great proportion in favour of water
enables fish to breathe by passing the water through the gills. Marine
animals (not fishes), like the whale,—which is a warm-blooded creature, and
therefore not suited to exist without air,—are obliged to come to the surface
to breathe. The density of salt water is much greater than that of fresh
water, and therefore swimming and flotation is easier in the sea than in a
river. We shall have more to say of water by-and-by.</p>

<p>We have already made some reference to this gas when speaking of the
atmosphere and its constituents, of which nitrogen is the principal. From
its life-destroying properties it is called
“azote” by French chemists, and when
we wish to obtain a supply of nitrogen
all we have to do is to take away the
oxygen from the air by burning phosphorus
on water under a glass. Nitrogen
is not found frequently in solid portions
of the globe. It is abundant in
animals. It is without colour or smell,
and can be breathed in air without
danger. It is heavy and sluggish;
but if we put a taper into a jar of
nitrogen it will go out, and animals die
in the gas for want of oxygen, as nitrogen alone cannot support life.</p>

<p>These compounds are usually taken as representative examples of combining
weight, and as explanatory of the symbolic nomenclature of chemistry,
as they advance in such regular proportions of oxygen with nitrogen. The
combining weight of nitrogen is 14, and when two parts combine with five
of oxygen it makes nitric acid, and we put it down as N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; on adding
water, HNO<sub>3</sub>, as we can see by eliminating the constituents and putting in
the proportions. Actually it is H<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, or, by division, HNO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>Nitrogen plays a very important part in nature, particularly in the
vegetable kingdom. Nitric acid has been known for centuries. Geber, the
alchemist, was acquainted with a substance called “nitric,” which he found
would yield a dissolvent under certain circumstances. He called it “dissolving
fluid.” At the end of the twelfth century Albert Magnus investigated
the properties of this acid, and in 1235 Raymond Lully prepared nitre
with clay, and gave the liquid the name of “aqua-fortis.” But till 1849
nitric acid was only known as a hydrate,—that is, in combination with water,—but
now we have the anhydrous acid.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 351.—Apparatus for obtaining nitrogen by using metal to absorb the oxygen of the air.</div>
</div>

<p>Oxygen and nitrogen combine under the influence of electricity, as
shown by Cavendish, who passed a current through an atmospheric mixture
of oxygen and nitrogen, in a tube terminating in a solution of potash, lime,
and soda. Every time the spark passed, the volume of gas diminished, and
nitric acid was formed, as it is in thunderstorms, when it does not remain free,
but unites with ammonia, and forms a highly useful salt, which promotes
vegetable growth. Here is another instance of the usefulness of thunderstorms,
and of the grand provisions of nature for our benefit. Nitric acid is
obtained by distilling nitre with sulphuric acid. The liquid is, when pure,
colourless, and is a powerful oxidizer. It dissolves most metals, and destroys
vegetable and animal substances. By an addition of a little sulphuric acid
the water is taken from the nitric acid, and a very powerful form of it is
the result. The acid is of great use in medicine, and as an application to
bites of rabid animals or serpents. It converts cotton waste into “gun-cotton”
by a very simple process of steeping, washing, and pressing. From
the hydraulic press it comes in discs like “quoits,” which will burn harmlessly
and smoulder away, but if detonated they explode with great violence.
As a rule, when damp, it is not dangerous, but it can be fired even when
wet. It will explode at a less temperature than gunpowder, and, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
yields no smoke, nor does it foul a gun. Gun-cotton, when dissolved in ether,
gives us collodion for photographic purposes.</p>

<p>In speaking farther of the compounds of nitrogen with oxygen, we will
limit ourselves to the monoxide, or laughing gas. This is now used as an
anæsthetic in dentistry, etc., and is quite successful, as a rule. People
afflicted with heart disease should not use it without advice, however.
When inhaled into the lungs it makes the subject very hilarious, and the
effect is rather noisy. It is obtained from the nitrate of ammonia, which, on
the application of heat, decomposes into nitrous oxide and vapour. Warm
water should be used for the trough. The gas is a powerful supporter of
combustion.</p>

<p>Nitrogen combines with hydrogen, forming various compounds. These
are the “amines,” also ammonia, and ammonium. Ammonia possesses the
properties of a base. Its name is derived from Jupiter Ammon, near
whose temple it was prepared, from camels’ dung. But bodies containing
nitrogen give off ammonia in course of distilling, and hartshorn is the
term applied to horn-cuttings, which yield ammonia, which is a colourless
gas of strong odour and taste now obtained from gas-works.</p>

<div class="caption"> Fig. 357.—Generation of ammonia.</div>
</div>

<p>To obtain ammonia heat equal parts of chloride of ammonia (sal
ammoniac) and quick-lime powdered (<i>see</i> fig. 357). The gas must be collected
over mercury, because it is very soluble in water. Ammonia is
useful to restore tipsy people and fainting ladies. A solution of ammonia
is used for cauteries. Ammoniacal gas is remarkable for its solubility in
water. To prepare the solution the gas is forced through a series of
flasks. The tubes carrying the gas should be continued to the bottoms
of the flasks, else the solution, being lighter than water, the upper portion
alone would be saturated. The tubes carrying away the solution are raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
a little, so that the renewal is continually proceeding. The gas liquifies
under a pressure of six atmospheres, at a temperature of 10° Cent. This
experiment can be artificially performed by heating chloride of silver saturated
with ammonia, and the silver will part with the gas at a temperature
of 40° C. The gas will then condense in a liquid form in the tube. The
experiment may be facilitated by placing the other extremity of the tube in
snow and salt, and by the liquid we can obtain intense cold. This experiment
has been made use of by M. Carré in his refrigerator (which was
described in the Physics’ section), by which he freezes water. We may,
however, just refer to the process. Whenever the condition of a body is
changed from that of liquid to a gas, the temperature is greatly lowered,
because the heat becomes “latent.” The latest freezing machine consists of
an apparatus as shown in the illustrations herewith (figs. 359 and 360). The
machine is of wrought iron, and contains, when ready for action, a saturated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
solution of ammonia at zero. This is in communication with another and
an air-tight vessel, of which the centre is hollow. The first process is to
heat the solution, and the gas escapes into the second “vase,” which is surrounded
by cold water, and quite unable to escape. A tremendous pressure
is soon obtained, and this, added to the cold water, before long liquifies the
ammonia, and when the temperature indicates 130° the hot vessel is suddenly
cooled by being put into the water. The gas is thus suddenly converted
into a liquid, the water in the second hollow vase is taken out, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
bottle to be frozen is put into the cavity. The cold is so great, in consequence
of the transformation of the liquid ammonia into a gas, that it freezes
the water in any vessel put into the receiver. The ammonia can be reconverted
into liquid and back again, so no loss is occasioned by the process,
which is rapid and simple. This is how great blocks of ice are produced in
water-bottles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_364a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 358.—Liquefaction of ammonia.</div>
</div>

<p>The one important point upon which care is necessary is the raising of
the temperature. If it be elevated beyond 130° C., the pressure will be too
great, and an explosion will occur.</p>

<p>The abundant formation of ammonia from decaying animal matter
is evident to everyone, and depends upon the presence of moisture to a
great extent. Chloride of ammonia is called sal-ammoniac, and the
carbonate of ammonia crystallizes from the alkaline liquid produced by the
distillation of certain animal matter. The compounds of ammonia are
easily recognized by a certain sharp taste. They are highly valuable
remedial agents, acting particularly
upon the cutaneous
system, and when taken internally,
produce the effect of
powerful sudorifics. Their
<em>volatility</em>, and the facility with
which they are expelled from
other substances, render them
of great importance in chemistry,
and peculiarly fit them
for the purposes of many
chemical analyses. The ammonia
compounds display a
remarkable analogy to the
corresponding combinations of
potash and soda. The compounds
of ammonia are highly important in their relation to the vegetable
kingdom. It may be assumed that all the <em>nitrogen</em> of plants is derived
from the ammonia which they absorb from the soil, and from the surrounding
atmosphere.</p>

<p>The similarity of ammonia to the metallic oxides has led to the
conjecture that all its combinations contain a <em>compound</em> metallic body, which
has received the name <em>ammonium</em> (NH<sub>4</sub>); but no one has yet succeeded in
its preparation, although by peculiar processes it may be obtained in the
form of an amalgam.</p>

<p>Ammonias, in which one or more atoms of hydrogen are replaced by
basic radicals, are termed <em>Amides</em>, or <em>Amines</em>.</p>

<small>NON-METALLIC ELEMENTS (<i>continued</i>).</small></h2>

<p class="hang">CHLORINE—BROMINE—IODINE—FLUORINE—CARBON—SULPHUR—PHOSPHORUS—SILICON—BORON—TELLURIUM—ARSENIC.</p>


<p>Chlorine (Cl.) is usually found with sodium in the mineral kingdom, and
this chloride of sodium is our common salt. Chlorine can be obtained by
heating hydrochloric acid with binoxide of manganese. (Atomic weight 35·5.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_366.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 361.—Generation of chlorine.</div>
</div>

<p>Chlorine possesses a greenish-yellow colour, hence its name “Chloros,”
green. It should be handled carefully, for it is highly injurious and suffocating.
It possesses a great affinity for other substances, and attacks the
metals. For hydrogen it has a great affection, and when hydrogen is combined
with any other substances chlorine immediately attacks them, and in
time destroys them. But even this destructive and apparently objectionable
quality makes chlorine very valuable; for if we carry the idea to its conclu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>sion,
we shall find that it also destroys offensive and putrid matter, and
purifies the atmosphere very much. Most colouring matters include
hydrogen, and therefore they are destroyed by chlorine, which is a great
“bleacher” as well as a purifier. If we dip any vegetable dyes into a jar of
chlorine, they will become white if the dyed substances are damp.</p>

<p>Hydrochloric acid is known as muriatic acid and spirits of salt. It is
obtained when salt is treated with sulphuric acid and the gas comes off into
water. Equal parts of the acid and the salt are put into a flask as in the
cut (fig. 362), and diluted with water. The mixture is then heated. The
gas is condensed in the bottles half-full of water. The result gives sulphate
of soda and hydrochloric acid. This acid is procured in soda manufactories,
and with nitric acid is called “aqua regia,” a solvent for gold. When
chlorine and hydrogen are mixed in equal proportions they explode in sunlight.
In the dark or by candle-light they are harmless. Dry chlorine
gas can be obtained by interposing a glass filled with some chloride of
calcium. The gas being heavier than air (about 2&frac12; times), displaces it in
the flask, and when it is filled another can be placed in position. This
mode causes a little waste of gas, which should not be breathed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_367.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> Fig. 362.—Production of hydrochloric acid.</div>
</div>

<p>Chlorine possesses a great affinity for certain bodies. If the gas be
thrown upon phosphorus, the latter will burn brilliantly. Arsenic, tin, and
antimony when powdered and poured from a shoot into a vase of chlorine
will burst into brilliant sparks, and other metals will glow when introduced
to this gas. Chlorine forms many unstable combinations with oxygen. Its
combination with hydrogen has already been referred to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bromine</span> is a rare element. (Symbol Br. Atomic weight 80.)</p>

<p>It is deep brownish red, very volatile, and of a peculiar odour.
Bromine unites with the elementary bodies, and forms some oxygen compounds.
It resembles chlorine in its properties, and is used in medicine
and in photography. It is found in saline springs and in salt water, combined
with soda and magnesium. The presence of bromine may easily be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
detected in the strong smell of seaweed. Its combinations with metals are
termed bromides. It is a powerful poison.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iodine</span> is another relative of chlorine. It is found in seaweed, which
by burning is reduced to <em>kelp</em>. When iodine is heated a beautiful violet
vapour comes off, and this characteristic has given it its name (“iodes,” violet).
Iodine was discovered by Courtois, of Paris, and in 1813, Gay Lussac made it
a special study. It is solid at ordinary temperatures, and assumes
crystallized forms in plates of metallic lustre. It is an excellent remedy in
“goitre” and such affections. (Symbol I. Atomic weight 127.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fluorine</span> is very difficult to prepare. Fluor spar is a compound of
fluorine and calcium. This element is gaseous, and combines so rapidly
that it is very difficult to obtain in a free state. Etching on glass is accomplished
by means of hydrofluoric acid, for fluorine has a great affinity for
silicic acid, which is contained in glass. The glass is covered with wax,
and the design is traced with a needle. The acid attacks the glass and
leaves the wax, so the design is eaten in. (Symbol F. Atomic weight 19.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_368.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 363.—Apparatus for obtaining dry chlorine gas.</div>
</div>

<p>Chlorine, fluorine, bromine, and iodine are termed “Halogens”
(producers of salts). They appear, as we have seen, in a gaseous, liquid, and
solid form respectively.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carbon</span> is the most, or one of the most, largely diffused elements in
nature, and claims more than a passing notice at our hands, though even
that must be brief. We may put down carbon next to oxygen as the most
important element in the world. The forms assumed by carbon are very
variable, and pervade nature in all its phases. We have carbon in crystals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and amongst the chief minerals a solid,
odourless, tasteless, infusible, and almost insoluble body. In various combinations
carbon meets us at every turn; united with oxygen it forms
carbonic acid, which we exhale for the plants to imbibe. We have it in
coal, with hydrogen and oxygen. We have it building up animal tissues,
and it is never absent in two out of the three great divisions of nature—the
plants and the animals (Symbol C; Atomic W. 12).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 365.—Facets of a rose diamond.</div>
</div>

<p>We have carbon in three different and well-known conditions; as the
diamond, as graphite, or black-lead, and as charcoal. The properties of
the diamond are well known, and we shall, when we get to Crystallography,
learn the forms of diamond or crystals of carbon. At present we give an
illustration or two, reserving all explanation for the present. Diamond
cutting is a matter of some difficulty, and it requires skill to cut in the
proper direction. Diamonds are found in India, Brazil, and at the Cape of
Good Hope, in alluvial soil. The identity of diamond and charcoal was
discovered accidentally. An experiment to fuse a few small diamonds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
resulted in their disappearance, and when the residue was examined it was
found that the diamonds had been burned, that they had combined with
oxygen and formed carbonic acid, just as when coal burns. The diamond is
the hardest of all substances, the most valuable of gems, and the purest
condition in which carbon appears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Graphite</span> (Plumbago) is termed “black-lead,” and is the next purest
form of carbon. It crystallizes and belongs to the primitive formations.
In Cumberland it is dug up and used to make pencils; the operations can
be seen at Keswick. It has other uses of a domestic character.</p>

<p>Charcoal is the third form of carbon, and as it possesses no definite
form, is said to be <em>amorphous</em>. Charcoal is prepared in air-tight ovens, so
that no oxygen can enter and burn the wood thus treated. Coke is the
result of the same process applied to coal. The gas manufactories are the
chief depôts for this article, and it is used in locomotive engines. The
various smokeless coals and prepared fuels, however, are frequently substituted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_370.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> Fig. 366.—Coke ovens.</div>
</div>

<p>Coke ovens were formerly much resorted to by the railway companies,
who found the ordinary coal too smoky for locomotive purposes, and apt to
give rise to complaints by passengers and residents near the line.</p>

<p>The origin of wood charcoal we have seen. All vegetable substances
contain carbon. When we burn wood, in the absence of air as far as
possible, oxygen and hydrogen are expelled. The wood is piled in layers as
in the illustration (fig. 368), covered over with turf and mould, with occasional
apertures for air. This mass is ignited, the oxygen and hydrogen are driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
off, and carbon remains. (Animal charcoal is obtained from calcining
bones). Wood charcoal attracts vapours, and water, if impure, can be
purified by charcoal, and any impure or tainted animal matter can be
rendered inoffensive by reason of charcoal absorbing the gases, while the
process of decay goes on just the same.
Housekeepers should therefore not always
decide that meat is good because it is not
offensive to the olfactory nerves. Charcoal
will remove the aroma, but the meat may be
nevertheless bad. The use of charcoal in
filters is acknowledged universally, and as a
constituent of gunpowder it is important.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_371a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 367.—Charcoal burning.</div>
</div>

<p>Carbon is not easily affected by the atmospheric
air, or in the earth; so in many instances wood is charred
before being driven into the ground; and casks for water are prepared
so. Soot is carbon in a pulverised condition, and Indian ink is manufactured
with its assistance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_371.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 368.—Wood piles of charcoal burners.</div>
</div>

<p>The preparation of wood charcoal gives occupation to men who are
frequently wild and untutored, but the results of their labour are very
beneficial. Care should be taken not to sleep in a room with a charcoal
stove burning, unless there is ample vent for the carbonic acid gas, for it
will cause suffocation. Lampblack is obtained by holding a plate over the
flame of some resinous substance, which deposits the black upon it. There
is a special apparatus for this purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_372.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 369.—Seltzer-water manufactory.</div>
</div>

<p>Carbon combines with oxygen to make carbonic acid gas, as we have
already mentioned, and in other proportions to form a more deadly compound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>than the other. The former is the dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), the latter the
monoxide, or carbonic oxide (CO). The dioxide is the more important,
being held in the atmosphere, and combined with lime in chalk. All
sparkling beverages contain carbonic acid, to which their effervescence is
due. The soda and other mineral waters owe their sparkle to this gas.
Soda-water consists of a weak solution of carbonate of soda and the acid.
There is a vessel holding chalk and water, and another containing some
sulphuric acid. When the sulphuric acid is permitted to unite with the
chalk and water, carbonic acid is liberated. A boy turning a wheel forces
the gas into the water in the bottles, or the water and carbonate of soda is
drawn off thus impregnated into bottles and corked down, in the manner
so familiar to all. The bottles are made of the shape depicted, so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
bubble of air shall be at the top when the bottle lies down. If it be not kept
so, the air will eventually escape, no matter how tightly
the cork be put in. The ordinary “soda-water” contains
scarcely any soda. It is merely water, chalk,
and carbonic acid. The “Gazogene” is made useful
for small quantities of soda-water, and is arranged
in the following manner. The appearance of it is
familiar to all. It consists of a double vessel, into
the upper part of which a solution of any kind—wine
and water, or even plain water—is put, to be saturated
with carbonic acid, or “aerated,” and into the lower
one some carbonate of soda and tartaric acid. A
tube leads from this lower to the top of the upper
vessel, which screws on and off. By shaking the
apparatus when thus charged and screwed together,
some of the liquid descends through the tube into
the lower vessel and moistens the soda and acid, which therefore act on
each other, and cause carbonic acid to be disengaged; this, rising up
through the tube (which is perforated with small holes at the upper part),
disperses itself through the liquid in small bubbles, and causes sufficient
pressure to enable the liquid to absorb it, which therefore effervesces when
drawn off by the tap.</p>

<p>Carbonic acid can be liquified, and then it is colourless. In a solid
form it resembles snow, and if pressed with the fingers it will blister them.
Being very heavy the gas can be poured into a vase, and if there be a
light in the receptacle the flame will be immediately extinguished.</p>

<p>That even the gas introduced into seltzer-water is capable of destroying
life, the following experiment will prove. Let us place a bird within a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
glass case as in the illustration (fig. 373), and connect the glass with a
bottle of seltzer-water or a siphon. As soon as the
liquid enters, the carbonic acid will ascend, and this,
if continued for a long time, would suffocate the bird,
which soon begins to develop an appearance of
restlessness.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_374a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 372.—Pouring out the carbonic acid gas.</div>
</div>

<p>We have already remarked upon the important
part taken by this gas in nature, so we need only
mention its existence in pits and caves. There are
many places in which the vapour is so strong as to
render the localities uninhabitable. In the Middle
Ages the vapours were attributed to the presence of
evil spirits, who were supposed to extinguish miners’
lamps, and suffocate people who ventured into the
caves. In the Grotto Del Cane there is still an
example, and certain caves of Montrouge are often filled with the gas.
A lighted taper held in the hand will, by its extinction, give the necessary
warning. Oxygen and carbon are condensed in carbonic acid, for the gas
contains a volume of oxygen equal to its own. If we fill a glass globe, as
per illustration (fig. 374), with pure oxygen, and in the globe insert two carbon
points, through which we pass a current of electricity, we shall find, after the
experiment, that if the stop-cock be opened, there is no escape of gas, and
yet the mercury does not rise in the tube, so the oxygen absorbed has been
replaced by an equal volume of carbonic acid.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_374b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 373.—Experiment with carbonic acid.</div>
</div>

<p>The other combination of carbon with oxygen is the carbonic oxide
(CO), and when a small quantity of oxygen is burnt with it it gives a blue
flame, as on the top of the fire in our ordinary grates. This gas is present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
in lime kilns, and is a very deadly one. We must now pass rapidly through
the compounds of carbon with hydrogen, merely referring to coal for a
moment as we go on.</p>

<p>Coal, of which we shall learn more in Mineralogy and Geology, is a combination,
mechanical or otherwise, and is the result of the decomposition of
vegetable matter in remote ages,—the so-called “forests,” which were more
like the jungles than the woods of the present day. Moss and fern played
prominent parts in this great transformation, as we can see in the Irish peat-bogs,
where the first steps to the coal measures are taken.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_375a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 374.—Experiment showing that carbonic acid contains oxygen and carbon.</div>
</div>

<p>The compounds of carbon with hydrogen are important. There is the
“light” carburetted hydrogen (CH<sub>4</sub>), which is usually known as fire-damp
in coal mines. It is highly inflammable and dangerous. The safety-lamp
invented by Davy is a great protection against it, for as the gas enters it is
cooled by the wire, and burns within harmlessly. The explosion warns the
miner. “Heavy” carburetted hydrogen
possesses double the quantity
of carbon (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>). It is also explosive
when mixed with oxygen.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_375b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 375.—Temperature reduced by contact with wire.</div>
</div>

<p>The most useful compound is
coal-gas, and though its principal
function appears to be in some
manner superseded by electricity,
“gas” is still too important to be
put aside. It can easily be obtained by putting small fragments of coal
in the bowl of a tobacco-pipe, closing the bowl with clay, and putting it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
the fire. Before long the gas will issue from the stem of the pipe, and
may either be lighted or collected in a bladder. For the use of the
“million,” however, gas is prepared upon a
very large scale, and is divided into three
processes—its “formation,” “purification,”
and its “collection” for distribution to
consumers. The first process is carried on
by means of retorts shown in the illustration
(fig. 376). The first portion of the next figure
is a section of a furnace, the other part shows
two furnaces from the front. The following
is the mode employed. The coal is put
into retorts fitted to the furnace, so that they
are surrounded by the flames, and terminating
in a horizontal tube called the
hydraulic main, <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>, which is in its turn connected
with a pit or opening for the reception of the tar and ammoniacal
liquor, etc., which condenses from the gas. It then passes up and down
a series of tubes in water, called
a “condenser,” and in this are
reservoirs or receptacles for any
tar and ammonia that remain.
But sulphur is still present, so
the gas is carried to the purifying
apparatus (<span class="smcap lowercase">D</span> in fig. 378),
which consists of a large cylindrical
vessel air-tight, with an
inverted funnel, nearly filled with a mixture of lime and water. The gas
bubbles in, and the sulphur unites with the lime, while the gas rises to the
top (trays of lime are used when the gas enters from the bottom). The
Gasometer, a large vessel closed at the top and open below, dips into a large
trough of circular shape. The gasometer is balanced by weights and chains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
and may be raised (<i>See</i> fig. 379). When quite empty the top rests upon
the ground, and when the gas enters it is raised to the top of the frame
which supports it. We have now our Gasometer full. When the time
comes to fill the pipes for lighting purposes, some of the weights are
removed, the Gasometer falls down slowly, and forces the gas through the
tubes into the main supply to be distributed. About four cubic feet of
gas is obtained from every pound of coal. When gas and air become
mixed, the mixture is very explosive. In a house where an escape of
gas is detected let the windows be opened at the top, and no light
introduced for several minutes.</p>

<p>Gas, therefore, is very injurious, for it rapidly vitiates the atmosphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
it burns in, and is very trying to the eyes, as well as destructive to gilt
ornaments.</p>

<p>Tar is familiar to all readers, and though unpleasant to handle or to
smell, it produces the beautiful aniline dyes. Tar pills are very efficacious
for some blood disorders, and will remove pimples, etc., from the face, and
cure “boils” effectually. If a dose of five be taken first, in a day or two
four, and so on, no second remedy need be applied. We have known cases
finally cured, and no recurrence of boils ever ensued after this simple
remedy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 381.—Tar manufactory</div>
</div>

<p>Tar is one of the results left in the distillation both of wood and coal:
in places where wood is plentiful and tar in request, it is produced by
burning the wood for that purpose; and in some of the pits in which charcoal
is produced, an arrangement is made to collect the tar also. Coal-tar
and wood-tar are different in some respects, and are both distilled to procure
the napthas which bear their respective names. From wood-tar creosote is
also extracted, and it is this substance which gives the peculiar tarry
flavours to provisions, such as ham, bacon, or herrings, cured or preserved by
being smoked over wood fires. Tar is used as a sort of paint for covering
wood-work and cordage when much exposed to wet, which it resists better
than anything else at the same price; but the tar chiefly used for these
purposes is that produced by burning fir or deal wood and condensing the
tar in a pit below the stack of wood; it is called Stockholm tar, as it comes
chiefly from that place.</p>

<p>Carbon only combines with nitrogen under peculiar circumstances.
This indirect combination is termed <em>cyanogen</em> (CN). It was discovered by
Gay-Lussac, and is used for the production of Prussian blue. Hydrocyanide
of potassium (Prussic acid) is prepared by heating cyanide of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
potassium with sulphuric acid. It is a deadly poison, and found in peach-stones.
Free cyanogen is a gas. The bisulphide of carbon is a colourless,
transparent liquid. It will easily dissolve sulphur and phosphorus and
several resins. When phosphorus is dissolved in it, it makes a very dangerous
“fire,” and one difficult to extinguish. We must now leave carbon and
its combinations, and come to sulphur.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_379.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 382.—Sulphur furnace.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sulphur</span> is found in a native state in Sicily and many other localities
which are volcanic. It is a yellow, solid body, and as it is never perfectly
free from earthy matter, it must be purified before it can be used. It
possesses neither taste nor smell, and is insoluble in water. Sulphur is
purified in a retort, <span class="smcap lowercase">C D</span>, which communicates with a brick chamber, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>. The
retort is placed over a furnace, <span class="smcap lowercase">K</span>, and the vapour passes into the chimney
through the tube, <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>, where it condenses into fine powder called “flowers of
sulphur” (brimstone). A valve permits the heated air to pass off, while
no exterior air can pass in, for explosions would take place were the heated
vapour to meet the atmospheric air. The danger is avoided by putting an
air reservoir outside the chimney which is heated by the furnace. The
sulphur is drawn out through the aperture, <i>r</i>, when deposited on the floor of
the chamber. The sulphur is cast into cylinders and sold. Sulphur is
soluble in bisulphide of carbon, and is used as a medical agent.</p>

<p>The compounds of sulphurs with oxygen form an interesting series.
There are two anhydrous oxides (anhydrides),—viz., sulphurous and sulphuric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>anhydride (SO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>3</sub>). There are two notable acids formed by the
combination with water, sulphurous and sulphuric, and some others, which,
as in the case of nitrogen, form a series of multiple proportions, the oxygen
being present in an increasing regularity of progression, as follows:—</p>

<p>The sulphurous anhydride mentioned above is produced when we burn
sulphur in the air, or in oxygen; it may be obtained in other ways. It is a
colourless gas, and when subjected to pressure may be liquified, and crystallized
at very low temperature. It was formerly called sulphuric acid. It
is a powerful “reducing agent,” and a good antiseptic.
It dissolves in water, and forms the
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, now known as sulphurous acid.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid is a most dangerous agent
in wicked or inexperienced hands, and amateurs
should be very careful when dealing with it. It
takes the water from the moist air, and from
vegetable and animal substances. It carbonizes
and destroys all animal tissues. Its discovery
is due to Basil Valentine, in 1440. He distilled
sulphate of iron, or green vitriol, and the result was “oil of vitriol.”
It is still manufactured in this way in the Hartz district, and the acid
passes by retorts into receivers. The earthen retorts, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, are arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
in the furnace as in the illustration, and the receivers, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, containing a
little sulphuric acid, are firmly fixed to them. The oily brown product
fumes in the air, and is called “fuming sulphuric acid,” or Nordhausen
acid. Sulphuric acid is very much used in chemical manufactures, and the
prices of many necessaries, such as soap, soda, calico, stearin, paper, etc.,
are in close relationship with the cost and production of sulphur, which also
plays an important part in the making of gunpowder. The manufacture of
the acid is carried on in platinum stills.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 385.—Experiment to show the existence of gases in solution.</div>

<p>Sulphuretted hydrogen, or the hydric sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S), is a colourless and
horribly-smelling gas, and arises from putrefying vegetable and animal
matter which contains sulphur. The odour of rotten eggs is due to this
gas, which is very dangerous when breathed in a pure state in drains, etc.
It can be made by treating a sulphide with sulphuric acid. It is capable
of precipitating the metals when in solution, and so by its aid we can discover
the metallic ingredient if it be present. The gas is soluble in water,
and makes its presence known in certain sulphur springs. The colour
imparted to egg-spoons and fish-knives and forks sometimes is due to the
presence of metallic sulphides. The solution is called hydro-sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phosphorus</span> occurs in very small quantities, though in the form of
phosphates we are acquainted with it pretty generally, and as such it is
absorbed by plants, and is useful in agricultural operations. In our organization—in
the brain, the nerves, flesh, and particularly in bones—phosphorus
is present, and likewise in all animals. Nevertheless it is highly poisonous.
It is usually obtained from the calcined bones of mammalia by obtaining
<em>phosphoric acid</em> by means of acting upon the bone-ash with sulphuric acid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
Phosphorus when pure is colourless, nearly transparent, soft, and easily cut.
It has a strong affinity for oxygen. It evolves white vapour in atmospheric
air, and is luminous; to this element is attributable the luminosity of bones
of decaying animal matter. It should be kept in water, and handled—or
indeed not handled—but grasped with a proper instrument.</p>

<p>Phosphorus is much used in the
manufacture of lucifer matches, and
we are all aware of the ghastly appearance
and ghostly presentment it
gives when rubbed upon the face and
hands in the dark. In the ripples of
the waves and under the counter of ships
at sea, the phosphorescence of the ocean
is very marked. In Calais harbour we
have frequently noticed it of a very
brilliant appearance as the mail steamer
slowly came to her moorings. This
appearance is due to the presence of
phosphorus in the tiny animalculæ of
the sea. It is also observable in the
female glow-worm, and the “fire-fly.”
Phosphorus was discovered by Brandt
in 1669.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_382.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 386.—Manufacture of sulphuric acid.</div>

<p>It forms two compounds with
oxygen-phosphorous acid, H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and
phosphoric acid, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. The compound
with hydrogen is well marked
as phosphuretted hydrogen, and is a
product of animal and vegetable decomposition.
It may frequently be
observed in stagnant pools, for when
emitted it becomes luminous by contact
with atmospheric air. There is
a very pretty but not altogether safe
experiment to be performed when
phosphuretted hydrogen has been prepared
in the following manner. Heat
small pieces of phosphorus with milk of
lime or a solution of caustic potash;
or make a paste of quick-lime and phosphorus, and put into the flask with
some quick-lime powdered. Fix a tube to the neck, and let the other end
be inserted in a basin of water. (<i>See</i> illustration, fig. 388.) Apply heat;
the phosphuretted hydrogen will be given off, and will emerge from the
water in the basin in luminous rings of a very beautiful appearance. The
greatest care should be taken in the performance of this very simple experi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>ment.
<em>No water must on any account come in contact with the mixture in
the flask.</em> If even a drop or two find its way in through the bent tube a
tremendous explosion will result, and then the fire generated will surely
prove disastrous. The experiment can be performed in a cheaper and less
dangerous fashion by dropping phosphate of lime into the basin. We
strongly recommend the latter course to the student unless he has had some
practice in the handling of these inflammable substances, and learnt caution
by experience. The effect when the experiment is properly performed is
very good, the smoke rising in a succession of coloured rings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silicon</span> is not found in a free state in nature, but, combined with
oxygen, as <em>Silica</em> it constitutes the major portion of our earth, and even
occurs in wheat stalks and bones of animals. As flint or quartz (see
<em>Mineralogy</em>) it is very plentiful, and in its purest form is known as rock
crystal, and approaches the form of carbon known as diamond. When
separated from oxygen, silicon is a powder of greyish-brown appearance,
and when heated in an atmosphere of oxygen forms silicic “acid” again,
which, however, is not acid to the taste, and is also termed “silica,” or “silex.”
It is fused with great difficulty, but enters into the manufacture of glass in
the form of sand. The chemical composition of glass is mixed silicate of
potassium or sodium, with silicates of calcium, lead, etc. Ordinary window-glass
is a mixture of silicates of sodium and calcium; crown glass contains
calcium and silicate of potassium. Crystal glass is a mixture of the same
silicate and lead. Flint glass is of a heavier composition. Glass can be
coloured by copper to a gold tinge, blue by cobalt, green by chromium, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
Glass made on a large scale is composed of the following materials, according
to the kind of glass that is required.</p>

<p>Flint glass (“crystal”) is very heavy and moderately soft, very white
and bright. It is essentially a table-glass, and was used in the construction
of the Crystal Palace. Its composition is—pure white sea-sand, 52 parts,
potash 14 parts, oxide of lead, 34 parts = 100.</p>

<p>The ingredients to be made into glass (of whatever kind it may be) are
thoroughly mixed together and thrown from time to time into large crucibles
placed in a circle, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> (fig. 389), in a furnace resting on buttresses, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>,
and heated to whiteness by means of a fire in the centre, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, blown by a
blowing machine, the tube of which is seen at <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>. This
furnace is shown in prospective in fig. 390. The ingredients
melt and sink down into a clear fluid, throwing
up a scum, which is removed. This clear glass in
the fused state is kept at a white heat till all air-bubbles
have disappeared; the heat is then lowered to
a bright redness, when the glass assumes a consistence
and ductility suitable to the purposes of the “blower.”</p>

<p>Glass blowing requires great care and dexterity, and is done by twirling
a hollow rod of iron on one end of which is a globe of melted glass, the
workman blowing into the other end all the time. By reheating and
twirling a sheet of glass is produced. Plate glass is formed by pouring the
molten glass upon a table with raised edges. When cold it is ground with
emery powder, and then polished by machinery.</p>

<p>Many glass articles are cast, or “struck-up,” by compression in moulds,
and are made to resemble cut-glass, but they are much inferior in appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
The best are first blown, and afterwards cut and polished. Of whatever
kind of glass the article may be, it is so brittle that the slightest blow would
break it, a bad quality which is got rid of by a process
called “annealing,” that is, placing it while
quite hot on the floor of an oven, which is allowed to
cool very gradually. This slow cooling takes off the
brittleness, consequently articles of glass well annealed
are very much tougher than others, and will scarcely
break in boiling water.</p>

<p>The kind generally used for ornamental cutting
is flint-glass. Decanters and wine-glasses are therefore
made of it; it is very bright, white, and easily cut.
The cutting is performed by means of wheels of
different sizes and materials, turned by a treadle, as in
a common lathe, or by steam power; some wheels
are made of fine sandstone, some of iron, others of
tin or copper; the edges of some are square, or round, or sharp. They are
used with sand and water, or emery and water, stone wheels with water
only.</p>

<p>In a soluble form silicic acid is found in springs, and thus enters into
the composition of most plants and grasses, while the shells and scales of
“infusoria” consist of silica. As silicate of alumina,—<i>i.e.</i>, clay,—it plays a
very important <em>rôle</em> in our porcelain and pottery works.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boron</span> is found in volcanic districts, in lakes as boracic acid, in combination
with oxygen. It is a brownish-green, insoluble powder, in a free
state, but as boracic acid it is white. It is used to colour fireworks with the
beautiful green tints we see. Soda and boracic acid combine to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
borax (or biborate of soda). Another and inferior quality of this combination
is <em>tinkal</em>, found in Thibet. Borax is much used in art and manufactures,
and in glazing porcelain. (Symbol B, Atomic Weight 11).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selenium</span> is a very rare element. It was found by Berzilius in a
sulphuric-acid factory. It is not found in a free state in nature. It closely
resembles sulphur in its properties. Its union with hydrogen produces a
gas, seleniuretted hydrogen, which is even more offensive than sulphuretted
hydrogen. (Symbol Se, Atomic Weight 79).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tellurium</span> is also a rare substance generally found in combination
with gold and silver. It is like bismuth, and is lustrous in appearance.
Telluretted hydrogen is horrible as a gas. Tellurium, like selenium, sulphur,
and oxygen, combines with two atoms of hydrogen. (Symbol Te, Atomic
Weight 129).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsenic</span>, like tellurium, possesses many attributes of a metal, and on
the other hand has some resemblance to phosphorus. Arsenic is sometimes
found free, but usually combined with metals, and is reduced from the ores
by roasting; and uniting with oxygen in the air, is known as “white
arsenic.” The brilliant greens on papers, etc., contain arsenic, and are
poisonous on that account. Arsenic and hydrogen unite (as do sulphur and
hydrogen, etc.), and produce a foetid gas of a most deadly quality. This
element also unites with sulphur. If poured into a glass containing chlorine
it will sparkle and scintillate as in the illustration (fig. 395). (Symbol As,
Atomic Weight 75).</p>

<p>Before closing this division, and passing on to a brief review of the
<span class="smcap">Metals</span>, we would call attention to a few facts connected with the metalloids
we have been considering. Some, we have seen, unite with hydrogen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
only, as chlorine; some with two atoms of hydrogen, as oxygen, sulphur, etc.,
and some with three, as nitrogen and phosphorus; some again with four, as
carbon and silicon. It has been impossible in the pages we have been able
to devote to the Metalloids to do more than mention each briefly and incompletely,
but the student will find sufficient, we trust, to interest him, and to
induce him to search farther, while the general reader will have gathered
some few facts to add to his store of interesting knowledge. We now pass
on to the Metals.</p>

<small>THE METALS.</small></h2>

<p class="hang">WHAT METALS ARE—CHARACTERISTICS AND GENERAL PROPERTIES OF
METALS—CLASSIFICATION—SPECIFIC GRAVITY—DESCRIPTIONS.</p>


<p>We have learnt that the elements are divided into metalloids and metals, but
the line of demarcation is very faint. It is very difficult to define what a
metal is, though we can say what it is not. It is indeed impossible to give
any absolute definition of a metal, except as “an element which does not
unite with hydrogen, or with another metal to form a chemical compound.”
This definition has been lately given by Mr. Spencer, and we may accept
it as the nearest affirmative definition of a metal, though obviously not
quite accurate.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_388.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 396.—Laminater.</div>
</div>

<p>A metal is usually supposed to be
solid, heavy, opaque, ductile, malleable, and
tenacious; to possess good conducting powers
for heat and electricity, and to exhibit a
certain shiny appearance known as “metallic
lustre.” These are all the conditions, but
they are by no means necessary, for very
few metals possess them all, and many
non-metallic elements possess several. The
“alkali” metals are lighter than water;
mercury is a fluid. The opacity of a mass
is only in relation to its thickness, for
Faraday beat out metals into plates so thin
that they became transparent. All metals
are not malleable, nor are they ductile.
Tin and lead, for example, have very little ductility or tenacity, while
bismuth and antimony have none at all. Carbon is a much better
conductor of electricity than many metals in which such power is extremely
varied. Lustre, again, though possessed by metals, is a characteristic of
some non-metals. So we see that while we can easily say what is not a
metal, we can scarcely define an actual metal, nor depend upon unvarying
properties to guide us in our determination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p>

<p>The affinity of metals for oxygen is in an inverse ratio to their specific
gravity, as can be ascertained by experiment, when the heaviest metal will
be the least ready to oxidise. Metals differ in other respects, and thus
classification and division become easier. The fusibility of metals is of a
very wide range, rising from a temperature below zero to the highest heat
obtainable in the blow-pipe, and even then in the case of osmium there is
a difficulty. While there can be no question that certain elements, iron,
copper, gold, silver, etc., are metals proper, there are many which border upon
the line of demarcation very closely, and as in the case of arsenic even
occupy the debatable land.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Specific Gravity</span> is the relation which the weight of substance bears
to the weight of an equal volume of water, as already pointed out in <span class="smcap">Physics</span>.
The specific gravities of the metals vary very much, as will be seen from the
table following—water being, as usual, taken as 1:—</p>

<p>There are some metals which, instead of fusing,—that is, passing from the
solid to the liquid state,—go away in vapour. These are volatile metals.
Mercury, potassium, and sodium, can be thus distilled. Some do not expand
with heat, but contract (like ice), antimony and bismuth, for instance, while
air pressure has a considerable effect upon the fusing point. Some vaporise
at once without liquefying; others, such as iron, become soft before melting.</p>

<p>We cannot attempt an elaborate description of all the metals, but we
will endeavour to give a few particulars concerning the important ones,
leaving many parts for Mineralogy to supplement and enlarge upon. We
shall therefore mention only the most useful of the metals in this place.
We will commence with <span class="smcap">Potassium</span>.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Metals of the Alkalies.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potassium</span> has a bright, almost silvery, appearance, and is so greatly
attracted by oxygen that it cannot be kept anywhere if that element be present—not
even in water, for combustion will immediately ensue on water; and
in air it is rapidly tarnished. It burns with a beautiful violet colour, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
a very pretty experiment may easily be performed by throwing a piece
upon a basin of water. The fragment combines with the oxygen of the
water, the hydrogen is evolved, and burns, and the potassium vapour gives
the gas its purple or violet colour. The metal can be procured by pulverizing
carbonate of potassium and charcoal, and heating them in an iron
retort. The vapour condenses into globules in the receiver, which is surrounded
by ice in a wire basket. It must be collected and kept in naphtha,
or it would be oxidised. Potassium was first obtained by Sir Humphrey
Davy in 1807. Potash is the oxide of potassium, and comes from the
“ashes” of wood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_391.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 397.—Preparation of potassium.</div>
</div>

<p>The compounds of potassium are numerous, and exist in nature, and
by burning plants we can obtain potash (“pearlash”). Nitrate of potassium,
or nitre (saltpetre), (KNO<sub>3</sub>), is a very important salt. It is found in the East
Indies. It is a constituent of gunpowder, which consists of seventy-five
parts of nitre, fifteen of charcoal, and ten of sulphur. The hydrated oxide
of potassium, or “caustic potash” (obtained from the carbonate), is much
used in soap manufactories. It is called “caustic” from its property of cauterizing
the tissues. Iodide, bromide, and cyanide of potassium, are used
in medicine and photography.</p>

<img src="images/i_392a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 398.—Machine for cutting soap in bars.</div>
</div>

<p>Soap is made by combining soda (for hard soap), or potash (for soft
soap), with oil or tallow. Yellow soap has turpentine, and occasionally palm
oil, added. Oils and fats combine with metallic oxides, and oxide of lead
with olive oil and resin forms the adhesive plaister with which we are all
familiar when the mixture is spread upon linen. Fats boiled with potash
or soda make soaps; the glycerine is sometimes set free and purified as
we have it. Sometimes it is retained for glycerine soap. Fancy soap is
only common soap coloured. White and brown Windsor are the same
soap—in the latter case browned to imitate age! Soap is quite soluble in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
spirits, but in ordinary water it is not so greatly soluble, and produces a
lather, owing to the lime in the water being present in more or less quantity,
to make the water more or less “hard.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sodium</span> is not unlike potassium, not
only in appearance, but in its attributes;
it can be obtained from the carbonate, as
potassium is obtained from its carbonate.
<em>Soda</em> is the oxide of sodium, but the most
common and useful compound of sodium is
the chloride, or common salt, which is found
in mines in England, Poland, and elsewhere.
Salt may also be obtained by the evaporation
of sea water. Rock salt is got at Salzburg,
and the German salt mines and works produce a large quantity. The
<em>Carbonate of Soda</em> is manufactured from the chloride of sodium, although
it can be procured from the salsoda plants by burning. The chloride of
sodium is converted into sulphate, and then ignited with carbonate of lime
and charcoal. The soluble carbonate is extracted in warm water, and sold
in crystals as soda, or (anhydrous) “soda ash.” The large quantity of
hydrochloric acid produced in the first part of the process is used in the
process of making chloride of lime. A few years back, soda was got from
Hungary and various other countries where it exists as a natural efflorescence
on the shores of some lakes, also by burning sea-weeds, especially the common
bladder wrack (<em>Fucus vesiculosus</em>), the ashes of which were melted into
masses, and came to market in various states of purity. The bi-carbonate
of soda is obtained by passing carbonic acid gas over the carbonate crystals.
Soda does not attract moisture from the air. It is used in washing, in glass
manufactories, in dyeing, soap-making, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Sulphate of Soda</em> is “Glauber’s Salt”; it is also employed in glass-making.
Mixed with sulphuric acid and water, it forms a freezing mixture. Glass,
as we have seen, is made with silicic acid (sand), soda, potassa, oxide of
lead, and lime, and is an artificial silicate of soda.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lithium</span> is the lightest of metals, and
forms the link between alkaline and the alkaline
earth metals. The salts are found in many
places in solution. The chloride when decomposed

<p><span class="smcap">Ammonium</span> is only a conjectural metal. <em>Ammonia</em>, of which we have
already treated, is so like a metallic oxide that chemists have come to the
conclusion that its compounds contain a metallic body, which they have
named hypothetically <span class="smcap">Ammonium</span>. It is usually classed amongst the
alkaline metals. The salts of ammonia are important, and have already
been mentioned. Muriate (chloride) of ammonia, or sal-ammoniac, is analogous
to chloride of sodium and chloride of potassium. It is decomposed
by heating it with slaked lime, and then gaseous ammonia is given off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barium</span> is the first of the four metals we have
to notice in this group, and will not detain us
long, for it is little known in a free condition. Its
most important compound is heavy spar (<em>sulphate
of baryta</em>), which, when powdered, is employed as
a white paint. The oxide of barium, BaO, is
termed baryta.</p>

<p><em>Nitrate of Baryta</em> is used for “green fire,”
which is made as follows:—Sulphur, twenty parts;
chlorate of potassium, thirty-three parts; and nitrate
of baryta, eighty parts (by weight).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Calcium</span> forms a considerable quantity of our
earth’s crust. It is the metal of lime, which is
the oxide of calcium. In a metallic state it
possesses no great interest, but its combinations are very important to us.
<em>Lime</em> is, of course, familiar to all. It is obtained by evolving the carbonic
acid from carbonate of lime (CaO).</p>

<p>The properties of this lime are its white appearance, and it develops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
a considerable amount of heat when mixed with water, combining to make
hydrate of lime, or “slaked lime.” This soon crumbles into powder, and
as a mortar attracts the carbonic acid from the air, by which means it
assumes the carbonate and very solid form, which renders it valuable for
cement and mortar, which, when mixed with sand, hardens. Caustic lime is
used in whitewashing, etc.</p>

<p><em>Carbonate of Lime</em> (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) occurs in nature in various forms, as limestone,
chalk, marble, etc. Calc-spar (arragonite) is colourless, and occurs as
crystals. Marble is white (sometimes coloured by metallic oxides), hard,
and granular. Chalk is soft and pulverizing. It occurs in mountainous
masses, and in the tiniest shells, for carbonate of lime is the main component
of the shells of the crustacea, of corals, and of the shell of the egg; it enters
likewise into the composition of bones, and hence we must regard it as one
of the necessary constituents of the food of animals. It is an almost invariable
constituent of the waters we meet with in Nature, containing, as they
always do, a portion of carbonic acid, which has the power of dissolving
carbonate of lime. But when gently warmed, the volatile gas is expelled,
and the carbonate of lime deposited in the form of white incrustations upon
the bottom of the vessel, which are particularly observed on the bottoms
of tea-kettles, and if the water contains a large quantity of calcareous matter,
even our water-bottles and drinking-glasses become covered with a thin film
of carbonate of lime. These depositions may readily be removed by pouring
into the vessels a little dilute hydrochloric acid, or some strong vinegar, which
in a short time dissolves the carbonate of lime.</p>

<p><em>Sulphate of Lime</em> (CaSO<sub>4</sub>) is found in considerable masses, and is
commonly known under the name of <em>Gypsum</em>. It occurs either crystallized
or granulated, and is of dazzling whiteness; in the latter form it is termed
<em>Alabaster</em>, which is so soft as to admit of being cut with a chisel, and is
admirably adapted for various kinds of works of art. Gypsum contains
water of crystallization, which is expelled at a gentle heat. But when
ignited, ground, and mixed into a paste with water, it acquires the property
of entering into chemical combination with it, and forming the original
hydrate, which in a short time becomes perfectly solid. Thus it offers to the
artist a highly valuable material for preparing the well-known plaster of Paris
figures, and by its use the noblest statues of ancient and modern art have
now been placed within the reach of all. Gypsum, moreover, has received a
valuable application as manure. In water it is slightly soluble, and imparts
to it a disagreeable and somewhat bitterish, earthy taste. It is called
“selenite” when transparent.</p>

<p><em>Phosphate of Lime</em> constitutes the principal mass of the bones of animals,
and is extensively employed in the preparation of phosphorus; in the form
of ground bones it is likewise used as a manure. It appears to belong to
those mineral constituents which are essential to the nutrition of animals.
It is found in corn and cereals, and used in making bread; so we derive
the phosphorus which is so useful to our system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Chloride of Lime</em> is a white powder smelling of chlorine, and is produced
by passing the gas over the hydrate of lime spread on trays for the purpose.
It is the well-known “bleaching powder.” It is also used as a disinfectant.
The <em>Fluoride of Calcium</em> is Derbyshire spar, or “Blue John.” Fluor spar is
generally of a purple hue. We may add that hard water can be softened
by adding a little powdered lime to it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Magnesium</span> sometimes finds a place with the other metals, for it bears
a resemblance to zinc. Magnesium may be prepared by heating its chloride
with sodium. Salt is formed, and the metal is procured. It burns very
brightly, and forms an oxide of magnesia (MgO). Magnesium appears in the
formation of mountains occasionally. It is ductile and malleable, and may
be easily melted.</p>

<p><em>Carbonate of Magnesia</em>, combining with carbonate of lime, form the
Dolomite Hills. When pure, the carbonate is a light powder, and when
the carbonic acid is taken from it by burning it is called Calcined Magnesia.</p>

<p>The <em>Sulphate of Magnesia</em> occurs in sea-water, and in saline springs
such as Epsom. It is called “Epsom Salts.” Magnesium wire burns brightly,
and may be used as an illuminating agent for final scenes in private
theatricals. <em>Magnesite</em> will be mentioned among Minerals.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Strontium</span> is a rare metal, and is particularly useful in the composition
of “red-fire.” There are the carbonate and sulphate of strontium;
the latter is known as <em>Celestine</em>. The red fire above referred to can be made
as follows, in a <em>dry mixture</em>. Ten parts nitrate of strontia, 1&frac12; parts chlorate
of potassium, 3&frac12; parts of sulphur, 1 part sulphide of antimony, and &frac12; part
charcoal. Mix well without moisture, enclose in touch paper, and burn.
A gorgeous crimson fire will result.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Metals of the Earths.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aluminium</span> (Aluminum) is like gold in appearance when in alloy with
copper, and can be procured from its chloride by decomposition with
electricity. It occurs largely in nature in composition with clays and
slates. Its oxide, <em>alumina</em> (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), composes a number of minerals, and
accordingly forms a great mass of the earth. Alumina is present in various
forms (<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_424">Minerals</a>) in the earth, all of which will be mentioned under
Crystallography and Mineralogy. The other nine metals in this class do
not call for special notice.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Heavy Metals</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iron</span>, which is the most valuable of all our metals, may fitly head our list.
So many useful articles are made of it, that without consideration any one
can name twenty. The arts of peace and the glories of war are all
produced with the assistance of iron, and its occurrence with coal has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
rendered us the greatest service, and placed us at the head of nations.
It occurs native in meteoric stones.</p>

<p>Iron is obtained from certain ores in England and Sweden, and these
contain oxygen and iron (<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_424">Mineralogy</a>). We have thus to drive away
the former to obtain the latter. This is done by putting the ores in small
pieces into a blast furnace (fig. 402) mixed with limestone and coal. The
process of severing the metal from its ores is termed smelting, the air
supplied to the furnace being warmed, and termed the “hot blast.” The
“cold blast” is sometimes used. The ores when dug from the mine are
generally stamped into powder, then “roasted,”—that is, made hot, and kept
so for some time to drive off water,
sulphur, or arsenic, which would prevent
the “fluxes” acting properly.
The fluxes are substances which will
mix with, melt, and separate the
matters to be got rid of, the chief
being charcoal, coke, and limestone.
The ore is then mixed with the flux,
and the whole raised to a great
heat; as the metal is separated it
melts, runs to the bottom of the
“smelting furnace,” and is drawn off
into moulds made of sand; it is
thus cast into short thick bars called
“pigs,” so we hear of pig-iron, and
pig-lead. Iron is smelted from
“ironstone,” which is mixed with
coke and limestone. The heat required
to smelt iron is so very great,
that a steam-engine is now generally
employed to blow the furnace.
(Before the invention of the steam-engine,
water-mills were used for the
same purpose.) The smelting is
conducted in what is called a blast
furnace. When the metal has all been “reduced,” or melted, and run down
to the bottom of the furnace, a hole is made, out of which it runs into the
moulds; this is called “tapping the furnace.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_396.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 402.—Blast furnace.</div>
</div>

<p>Smelting is often confounded with melting, as the names are somewhat
alike, but the processes are entirely different; in melting, the metal is
simply liquefied, in smelting, the metal has to be produced from ores which
often have no appearance of containing any, as in the case of ironstone,
which looks like brown clay.</p>

<p>The cone of the furnace, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, is lined with fire-bricks, <i>i</i> <i>i</i>, which is encased
by a lining, <i>l</i> <i>l</i>; outside are more fire-bricks, and then masonry, <i>m</i> <i>n</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
<span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> is the throat of the furnace; <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span> the chimney. The lower part, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, is called
the <i>boshes</i>. As soon as the ore in the furnace has become ignited the
carbon and oxygen unite and form carbonic acid, which escapes, and the
metal fuses at last and runs away. The coal and ore are continually added
year after year. The glassy scum called “slag “ protects the molten iron
from oxidation.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 403.—General foundry, Woolwich Arsenal.</div>
</div>

<p>The metal drawn from the blast furnace is “pig iron,” or “cast” iron,
and contains carbon. This kind of iron is used for casting operations, and
runs into sand-moulds. It contracts very little when cooling. It is hard
and brittle.</p>

<p><em>Bar Iron</em> is the almost pure metal. It is remarkably tenacious, and
may be drawn into very fine wire or rolled. But it is not hard enough for
tools. It is difficult to fuse, and
must be welded by hammering at a
red heat. Wire-drawing is performed
by taking the metal as a bar, and
passing it between rollers (fig. 404),
which flattens it, and then between
a new set, which form cutting edges
on the rolled plate (fig. 405), the projections
of one set fitting into the
hollows of the other closely as in the
illustration. The strips of metal
come out at the aperture seen at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>
in the next illustration. These rods are drawn
through a series of diminishing holes in a steel
plate, occasionally being heated to keep it soft and
ductile. When the wire has got to a certain
fineness it is attached to a cylinder and drawn away, at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
time being wound round the cylinder over a small
fire. Some metals can be drawn much finer than
others. Gold wire can be obtained of a “thickness”
(or thinness) of only the 5,000th part of an
inch, 550 feet weighing one grain! But platinum
has exceeded this marvellous thinness, and wire
the 30,000th part of an inch has been produced.
Ductility and malleability are not always found
in the same metal in proportion. The sizes of
wires are gauged by the
instrument shown in the
margin. The farther the
wire will go into the groove
the smaller its “size.”</p>

<p>Steel contains a certain amount of carbon, generally about 1 to 2
per cent. Cast steel is prepared from cast iron. Steel from bar-iron has
carbon added, and is termed bar-steel. The process is called “cementation,”
and is carried on by packing the bars of iron in brick-work boxes, with a
mixture of salt and soot, or with charcoal, which is termed “cement.”
Steel is really a carbide of iron, and Mr. Bessemer founded his process of
making steel by blowing out the excess of carbon from the iron, so that the
proper amount—1·5 per cent.—should remain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_398d.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 408.—Coarse wire-drawing.</div>
</div>

<p>A brief summary of the Bessemer process may be interesting. If a
bar of steel as soft as iron be made red-hot and plunged into cold water, it
will become very hard. If it be then gently heated it will become less hard,
and is then fitted for surgical instruments. The various shades of steel are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
carefully watched,—the change of colour being due to the varying thickness
of the oxide; for we know that when light falls upon very thin films of
a substance,—soap-bubbles, for instance,—the light reflected from the under
and upper surfaces interfere, and cause colour, which varies with the thickness
of the film. These colours in steel correspond to different temperatures, and
the “temper” of the steel depends upon the temperature it has reached.
The following table extracted from Haydn’s “Dictionary of Science” gives
the “temper,” the colour, and the uses of the various kinds of steel.</p>

<p>The <em>Bessemer</em> process transfers the metal into a vessel in which there
are tubes, through which air is forced, which produces a much greater heat
than a bellows does. Thus in the process the carbon of the iron acts as fuel
to maintain the fusion, and at the same time by the bubbling of the
carbonic acid mixes the molten iron thoroughly.</p>

<p>During the bubbling up of the whole mass of iron, and the extreme
elevation of temperature caused by the union of the carbon of the impure
iron with the oxygen of the air, the oxide of iron is formed, and as fast as
it forms fuses into a sort of glass; this unites with the earthy matters of the
“impure” iron, and floats on the upper part as a flux, thus ridding the “cast
iron” of all its impurities, with no other fuel than that contained in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
metal itself, and in the air used. When the flame issuing from the
“converter” contracts and changes its colour, then the time is known to
have arrived when the iron is “ de-carbonized.” The amount of carbon
necessary is artificially added, ebullition takes place, a flame of carbonic
oxide comes out, and the metal is then run into ingots.</p>

<p>The compounds of iron which are soluble in water have a peculiar
taste called <em>chalybeate</em> (like ink). Many mineral springs are so flavoured, and
taste, as the immortal Samuel Weller put it, “like warm flat-irons.” Iron is
frequently used as a medicine to renew the blood globules.</p>

<p><em>Protoxide of Iron</em> is known only in combination.</p>

<p><em>Sesqui-Oxide of Iron</em> is “red ironstone.” Powdered it is called
English <em>rouge</em>, a pigment not altogether foreign to our use. In a pure state
it is a remedy for arsenical poisoning, and is really the “rust” upon iron.</p>

<p><em>Bisulphide of Iron</em> is iron pyrites, and is crystalline.</p>

<p><em>Chloride of Iron</em> is dissolved from iron with hydrochloric acid. It is
used in medicine.</p>

<p><em>Cyanide of Iron</em> makes, with cyanide of potassium, the well-known
prussiate of potash (ferro-cyanide of potassium), which, when heated, precipitates
Prussian blue (cyanogen and iron).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manganese</span> is found extensively, but not in any large quantities, in
one place; iron ore contains it. It is very hard to fuse, and is easily
oxidised. The binoxide is used to obtain oxygen, and when treated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
potassium and diluted, it becomes the permanganate of potassium, and is
used as “Condy’s fluid.” It readily oxides organic matters, and is thus a
disinfectant. It crystallizes in long, deep, red needles, which are dissolved in
water. It is a standard laboratory test. There are other compounds, but
in these pages we need not detail them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cobalt</span> and <span class="smcap">Nickel</span> occur together. They are hard, brittle, and
fusible. The salts of cobalt produce beautiful colours, and the chloride
yields an “invisible” or sympathetic ink. The oxide of cobalt forms a blue
pigment for staining glass which is called “smalt.” Nickel is chiefly used in
the preparation of German silver and electro-plating. The salts of nickel
are green. Nickel is difficult to melt, and always is one of the constituents
of meteoric iron, which falls from the sky in aërolites. It is magnetic like
cobalt, and is extracted from the ore called kupfer-nickel. A small United-States
coin is termed a “nickel.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Copper</span> is the next metal we have to notice. It has been known for
centuries. It is encountered native in many places. The Cornish copper
ore is the copper pyrites. The
fumes of the smelting works are
very injurious, containing, as they
do, arsenic and sulphur. The ground
near the mines is usually bare of
vegetation in consequence of the
“smoke.” Sheet copper is worked
into many domestic utensils, and
the alloy with zinc, termed <em>Brass</em>, is
both useful and ornamental. <em>Red
brass</em> is beaten into thin leaves, and
is by some supposed to be “gold
leaf”; it is used in decorative work. Bronze is also an alloy of copper, as
are gun-metal, bell-metal, etc.</p>

<p>Next to silver, copper is the best conductor of electricity we have. It
is very hard and tough, yet elastic, and possesses malleability and ductility
in a high degree. It forms two oxides, and there are several sulphides; the
principal of the latter are found native, and worked as ores. The sulphate
of copper is termed <em>blue vitriol</em>, and is used in calico-printing, and from it
all the (copper) pigments are derived. It is also used in solution by
agriculturists to protect wheat from insects. When copper or its alloys are
exposed to air and water, a carbonate of copper forms, which is termed
<em>verdigris</em>. All copper salts are poisonous; white of eggs is an excellent
remedy in such cases of poisoning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lead</span> is obtained from galena, a sulphide of lead. It is a soft and
easily-worked metal. When freshly cut it has quite a bright appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
which is quickly tarnished. Silver is often present in lead ore, and is
extracted by Pattison’s process, which consists in the adaptation of the
knowledge that lead containing silver
becomes solid, after melting, at a
<em>lower</em> temperature than lead does when
pure. Pure lead therefore solidifies
sooner.</p>

<p>One great use of lead is for our
domestic water-pipes, which remind us
in winter of their presence so disagreeably.
Shot is made from lead, and
bullets are cast from the same metal.
Shot-making is very simple, and before
the days of breech-loading guns and
cartridges, no doubt many readers have
cast bullets in the kitchen and run
them into the mould over a basin of
water or a box of sand. For sporting
purposes lead is mixed with arsenic,
and when it is melted it is poured
through a sort of sieve (as in the cut)
at the top of a high tower. (<i>See</i> figs.
413 and 414). The latter illustration
gives the section of the shot tower; <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> is the furnace, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> is the tank
for melting the lead, and the metal is permitted by the workman at <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> to
run through the sieve in fine streams. As the lead falls it congeals into
drops, which are received in water below to cool them. They are, of course,
not all round, and must be sorted. This operation is performed by placing
them on a board tilted up, and under which are two boxes. The round
shot rush over the first holes and drop into the second box, but the uneven
ones are caught lagging, and drop into box No. 1. They are accordingly
sent to the furnace again.</p>

<div class="figleft" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 412.—Shot tower.</div>
</div>

<p>The next process is to sort the good shot for size. This is done by
sieves—one having holes a <em>little larger</em> than
the size of shot required. This sieve passes
through it all of the right size and smaller,
and keeps the bigger ones. Those that have
passed this examination are then put into
another sieve, which has holes in it a <em>little
smaller</em> than the size of shot wanted. This sieve retains the right shot,
and lets the smaller sizes pass, and so on. The shot are sized and numbered,
glazed by rolling them in a barrel with graphite, and then they are
ready for use. Bullets are made by machinery by the thousand, and made
up into cartridges with great speed.</p>

<p>The compounds of lead are also poisonous, and produce “colic,” to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
which painters are subject. Red lead, or minium, is a compound of the
protoxide and the binoxide, and may be found native. The former oxide
is <em>litharge</em>; <em>white</em> lead, or the <em>carbonate of lead</em>, is a paint,
and is easily obtained by passing a stream of carbonic acid
into a solution of acetate of lead. It is used as a basis of
many paints.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tin</span> is another well-known metal. It is mentioned
by Moses. It possesses a silver-like lustre, and is not
liable to be oxidised. The only really important ore is called
Tinstone, from which the oxygen is separated, and the metal
remains. Cornwall has extensive tin mines. Tin is malleable
and ductile, and can be beaten into <em>foil</em> or “silver leaf,” or
drawn into wire. It prevents oxidation of iron if the latter
be covered with it, and for tinning copper vessels for culinary
purposes. The Romans found tin in Cornwall, and the
term “Stanneries” was applied to the courts of justice among
the tin miners in Edward the First’s time. We have already
mentioned the alloys of tin. The oxides of tin, “Stannous”
and “Stannic,” are useful to dyers. The latter is the tinstone
(SnO<sub>2</sub>). Sulphide of tin is called “Mosaic gold,” and
is much used for decorative purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zinc</span> is procured from <em>calamine</em>, or carbonate of zinc,
and <em>blende</em>, or sulphide of zinc. It has for some years been
used for many purposes for which lead was once employed,
as it is cheap and light. Zinc is a hard metal of a greyish
colour, not
easily bent,
and rather
brittle; but
when made nearly red-hot,
it can be rolled out into
sheets or beaten into form
by the hammer. Zinc is
about six-and-three-quarter
times heavier than water.
Like many other metals, it
is volatile (when heated to
a certain extent it passes off
into vapour), and the probable
reason that it was not
known or used of old is
that it was lost in the attempt
to smelt its ores. Zinc is now obtained by a sort of distil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>lation;
the ores are mixed with the flux in a large earthen crucible
or pot.</p>

<p>We have already noticed the alloy of zinc with copper (brass), and the
use of zinc to galvanize iron by covering the latter with a coating of zinc
in a bath is somewhat analogous to electro-plating. The metal is largely
used as the <em>positive</em> element in galvanic batteries, and for the production of
hydrogen in the laboratory. Zinc forms one oxide (ZnO), used for zinc-white.
The sulphate of zinc is white vitriol, and the chloride of zinc is an
“antiseptic.” Certain preparations of the metal are used in medicine as
“ointments” or “washes,” and are of use in inflammation of the eyelids.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chromium.</span> This “metallic element” is almost unknown in the
metallic state. But although little
known, the beautiful colours of its
compounds make it a very interesting
study. The very name leads one to
expect something different to the other
metals—<em>chroma</em>, colour. The metal is
procured from what is known as
chrome-ironstone, a combination of
protoxide of iron and sesqui-oxide of
chromium (FeOCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). By ignition with
potassium we get chromic acid and
chromate of potassium, a yellow salt
which is used to make the other compounds
of chromium. The metal is by
no means easy to fuse.</p>

<p>Sesqui-Oxide of Chromium is a
fine green powder employed in painting
porcelain.</p>

<p>Chromate of Lead is termed
“chrome yellow,” and in its varieties is
employed as a paint.</p>

<p>Chromate of Mercury is a beautiful vermilion. There are numerous
other combinations which need not be mentioned here.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 416.—Type-casting.</div>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Antimony</span> was discovered by Basil Valentine. The Latin term is
Stibium, hence its symbol, Sb. It is very crystalline, and of a peculiar
bluish-white tint. It will take fire at a certain high temperature, and can
be used for the manufacture of “Bengal Lights,” with nitre and sulphur in
the proportions of antimony “one,” the others two and three respectively.</p>

<p>The compounds of antimony are used in medicine, and are dangerous
when taken without advice. They act as emetics if taken in large quantities.
Our “tartar emetic” is well known.</p>

<p>Antimony, in alloy with lead and a little tin, form the <em>type metal</em> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
which we are indebted for our printing. Type-casting is done by hand, and
requires much dexterity. A ladle is dipped into the molten metal, and the
mould jerked in to fill it properly, and then the type is removed and the
mould shut ready for another type; and a skilful workman can perform
these operations five hundred times in an hour,—rather more than eight
times a minute,—producing a type each time; this has afterwards to be
finished off by others. The metal of which type is made consists of lead
and antimony; the antimony hardens it and makes it take a sharper
impression. The letters are first cut in steel, and from these “dies” the
moulds are made in brass, by stamping, and in these the types are cast.</p>

<p>Stereotype consists of plates of metal taken, by casting, from a forme
of type set up for the purpose: an impression was formerly carried on by
plaster-of-Paris moulds, but lately what is termed the <em>papier-maché</em> process
is adopted. The paper used is now made in England, and the prepared
sheet is placed upon the type and beaten upon it. Paste is then filled in
where there are blanks, and another and thicker sheet of the prepared paper
is placed over all, dried, and pressed. When this is properly done the paper
is hardened, and preserves an impression of the type set up. The paper
mould is then put into an iron box, and molten metal run in. In a very
short time a “stereotype” plate is prepared from the paper, which can be
used again if necessary. The metal plate is put on the machine.</p>

<p>There are several compounds of antimony, which, though valuable to
chemists, would not be very interesting to the majority of readers. We will
therefore at once pass to the Noble Metals.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Noble Metals.</span></p>

<p>There are nine metals which rank under the above denomination:—Mercury,
Silver, Gold, Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium, Ruthenium, Osmium,
Iridium. We will confine ourselves chiefly to the first four on the list.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mercury</span>, or <span class="smcap">Quicksilver</span>, is the first of the metals which remain
unaltered by exposure to atmospheric air, and thus are supposed to earn
their title of nobility. Mercury is familiar to us in our barometers, etc., and
is fluid in ordinary temperatures, though one of the heaviest metals we
possess. It is principally obtained from native cinnabar, or sulphide of
mercury (vermilion), and the process of extraction is very easy. Mercury
was known to the ancients, and is sometimes found native. In the mines
the evil effects of the contact with mercury are apparent.</p>

<p>This metal forms two oxides,—the black (mercurous) oxide, or suboxide
(Hg<sub>2</sub>O), and the red (mercuric) oxide, or red precipitate. The
chlorides are two,—the subchloride, or calomel, and the perchloride, or
corrosive sublimate. The sulphides correspond with the oxides; the
mercuric sulphide has been mentioned. Its crimson colour is apparent in
nature, but the Chinese prepare it in a particularly beautiful form. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
amalgams are made with mercury, which is useful in various ways that will
at once occur to the reader.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Silver</span> is the whitest and most beautiful of metals, and its use for our
plate and ornaments is general. It is malleable and ductile, and the best
conductor of electricity and heat that we have. It is not unfrequently
met with in its native state, but more generally it is found in combination
with gold and mercury, or in lead, copper, and antimony ores. The mines
of Peru and Mexico, with other Western States of America, are celebrated—Nevada,
Colorado, and Utah in particular. The story of the silver mine
would be as interesting as any narrative ever printed. The slavery and the
death-roll would equal in horror and in its length the terrible records of war
or pestilence. We have no opportunity here to follow it, or its kindred
metals with which it unites, on the sentimental side; but were the story of
silver production written in full, it would be most instructive.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_406.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 417.—Native silver.</div>
</div>

<p>Silver is found with lead (galena), which is
then smelted. The lead is volatilized, and the
silver remains. It is also extracted by the
following process, wherein the silver and golden
ore is crushed and washed, and quicksilver,
salt, and sulphate of copper added, while heat
is applied to the mass. From tank to tank
the slime flows, and deposits the metals, which
are put into retorts and heated. The mercury
flies off; the silver and gold remain in bars.</p>

<p>In some countries, as in Saxony and South
America, recourse is had to another process, that
of amalgamation, which depends on the easy
solubility of silver and other metals in mercury.
The ore, after being reduced to a fine powder, is mixed with common salt,
and roasted at a low red heat, whereby any sulphide of silver the ore may
contain is converted into chloride. The mixture is then placed, with some
water and iron filings, in a barrel which revolves round its axis, and the
whole agitated for some time, during which process the chloride of silver
becomes reduced to the metallic state. A portion of mercury is then
introduced, and the agitation continued. The mercury combines with the
silver, and the amalgam is then separated by washing. It is afterwards
pressed in woollen bags to free it from the greater part of the mercury, and
then heated, when the last trace of mercury volatilizes and leaves the silver
behind.</p>

<p><em>Nitrate of Silver</em> is obtained when metallic silver is dissolved in nitric
acid. It is known popularly as <em>lunar caustic</em>, and forms the base of
“marking inks.” <em>Chloride of silver</em> is altered by light, but the iodide of
silver is even more rapidly acted on, and is employed in photography.
<em>Fulminating silver</em> is oxide of silver digested in ammonia. It is very dan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>gerous
in inexperienced hands. It is also prepared by dissolving silver in
nitric acid, and adding alcohol. It cools in crystals. Fulminating mercury
is prepared in the same way.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Gold</span> is the most valuable of all metals,—the “king of metals,” as
it was termed by the ancients. It is always found “native,” frequently
with silver and copper. Quartz is the rock wherein it occurs. From the
disintegration of these rocks the gold sands of rivers are formed, and
separated from the sands by “washing.” In Australia and California
“nuggets” are picked up of considerable size.</p>

<p>It is a rather soft metal, and, being likewise costly, is never used in an
absolutely pure state. Coins and jewellery are all alloyed with copper and
silver to give them the requisite hardness and durability. Gold is extremely
ductile, and very malleable. One grain of gold may be drawn into a wire
five hundred feet in length, and the metal may be beaten into almost
transparent leaves 1/200000 of an inch in thickness!</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_407.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 418.—Native gold.</div>
</div>

<p>Aqua-regia, a mixture of hydrochloric
and nitric acids, is used to dissolve
gold, which is solved only by selenic
acid, though the free chlorine will dissolve
it. Faraday made many experiments as
to the relation of gold to light. (<cite>See</cite>
“Phil. Trans.,” 1857, p. 145.) The
various uses of gold are so well known
that we need not occupy time and space
in recording them. Gilding can be
accomplished by immersing the articles
in a hot solution of chloride of gold and
bicarbonate of potash mixed; but the
electro process is that now in use, by which the gold precipitates on the
article to be plated.</p>

<p>We have already described the process of electro-plating in the case of
silvered articles, and we need only mention that electro-gilding is performed
very much in the same way. But gilding is also performed in other ways;
one of which, the so-called water gilding, is managed as follows. Gilding
with the gold-leaf is merely a mechanical operation, but water-gilding is
effected by chemistry.</p>

<p>Water-gilding is a process (in which, however, no water is used) for
covering the surface of metal with a thin coating of gold; the best metal
for water-gilding is either brass, or a mixture of brass and copper. A
mixture of gold and mercury, in the proportion of one part of gold to eight of
mercury, is made hot over a fire till they have united; it is then put into a
bag of chamois-leather, and the superfluous mercury pressed out. What
remains is called an “amalgam”; it is soft, and of a greasy nature, so that
it can be smeared over any surface with the fingers. The articles to be gilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
are made perfectly clean on the surface, and a liquid, made by dissolving
mercury in nitric acid (aqua-fortis), is passed over them with a brush made
of fine brass wire, called a “scratch-brush.” The mercury immediately
adheres to the surface of the metal, making it look like silver; when this is
done, a little of the amalgam is rubbed on, and the article evenly covered
with it. It is then heated in a charcoal fire till all the mercury evaporates,
and the brass is left with a coating of gold, which is very dull, but may be
burnished with a steel burnisher and made bright if necessary. In former
times articles were inlaid with thin plates of gold, which were placed in hollows
made with a graver, and melted in, a little borax being applied between.</p>

<p>When a solution of “chloride of gold” is mixed with ether, the ether
takes the gold away from the solution, and may be poured off the top charged
with it. This solution, if applied to polished steel by means of a camel-hair
pencil, rapidly evaporates, leaving a film of gold adhering to the steel, which,
when burnished with any hard substance, has a very elegant appearance.
In this way any ornamental design in gold may be produced, but it is not
very durable. The gilt ornaments, scrolls, and mottoes on sword-blades, are
sometimes done in this way.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Platinum</span> is the heaviest of all metals, gold being next. Platinum
is practically infusible, and quite indifferent to reagents. It is therefore
very useful in certain manufactories, and in the laboratory. It can be
dissolved by <em>aqua-regia</em>. The stills for sulphuric acid are made of platinum,
and the metal is used for Russian coinage, but must be very difficult to
work on account of its infusible property.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_408.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 419.—Döbereiner’s lamp.</div>
</div>

<p>In the finely-divided state it forms a gray and very porous mass, which
is known as <em>spongy platinum</em>, and possesses the remarkable property of condensing
gases within its pores. Hence, when a jet of hydrogen is directed
upon a piece of spongy platinum, the heat caused by its
condensation suffices to inflame the gas. This singular power
has been applied to the construction of a very beautiful
apparatus, known as Döbereiner’s lamp, which consists of a
glass jar, <i>a</i>, covered by a brass lid, <i>e</i>, which is furnished with a
suitable stop-cock, <i>c</i>, and in connection with a small bell jar, <i>f</i>,
in which is suspended, by means of a wire, a cylinder of
metallic zinc, <i>z</i>. When required for use, the outer jar is two-thirds
filled with a mixture of one part sulphuric acid and four
parts water, and the stop-cock opened to allow the escape of
atmospheric air, the spongy platinum contained in the small
brass cylinder, <i>d</i>, being covered by a piece of paper. The stop-cock is then
closed, and the bell jar, <i>f</i>, allowed to fill with hydrogen, and after it has been
filled and emptied several times, the paper is removed from the platinum
and the cock is again opened, when the gas, which escapes first, makes the
metal red-hot and finally inflames. This property of platinum is also used
in the “Davy” lamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>

<p>The remaining metals do not call for detailed notice.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we may refer to the following statement, which in general
terms gives the properties of the metals, their oxides and sulphides for
ordinary readers.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">General Classification of the Metals.</span></p>

<p>In the introduction to these brief chapters upon Chemistry, we said that the
science was divided into two sections, the first section consisting of the
simple combinations, and the other of compound combinations. The latter
being met with chiefly in animal and vegetable matter, as distinguished from
dead or inert matter, was termed <em>Organic</em>. This distinction will be seen
below.</p>

<p>We have already placed before our readers the elements and their simple
combinations, and have incidentally mentioned the decomposition by electricity
and by light. In the section upon Electricity the positive and negative
poles are explained. Oxygen appears always at the positive pole, potassium
at the negative. The other simple bodies vary. Chlorine, in combination
with oxygen, is evolved at the negative pole, but when with hydrogen at the
positive pole. In the series below each element behaves electro-<em>negatively</em>
<em>to those following it</em>, and electro-<em>positively</em> to those <em>above it</em>; and the farther
they are apart the stronger their opposite affinities are.</p>

<p>The importance of these facts to science is unmistakable, and, indeed,
many attempts have been made to explain, from the electrical condition of
the elements, the nature of chemical affinity, and of chemical phenomena in
general.</p>

<p>Electrotyping is another instance of decomposition by means of electricity,
and respecting decomposition by light we know how powerful the action of
the sun’s rays are upon plants, and for the evolution of oxygen. The
daguerreotype and photographic processes are also instances which we have
commented upon. So we can pass directly to the consideration of the
compound groups.</p>

<p>In nearly every complex organic compound we have a relatively simple
one of great stability, which is termed the <em>radical</em>, which forms, with other
bodies, a compound radical.<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> In these complex groups we find certain
elements generally,—viz., carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, and phosphorus.
Some compounds may consist of two of these, but the majority contain
three (hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon). Many have four (carbon, oxygen,
hydrogen, and nitrogen), and some more than four, including phosphorus
and sulphur. Others, again, may contain chlorine and its relatives, arsenic,
etc., in addition. Now we will all admit that in any case in which carbon
is present in composition with other simple bodies forming an organic body,
and if that body be ignited in the air, it burns and leaves (generally) a black
mass. This is a sure test of the presence of carbon, and forms an organic
compound. Similarly in decomposition nitrogen and sulphur in combination
inform us they are present by the odour they give off. We need not go
farther into this question of radicals and compound radicals than to state
that a compound radical plays the part of an element in combination. We
find in alcohol and ether a certain combination termed <em>Ethyl</em>. This
“compound radical” occurs in same proportions in ether, chloride of ethyl,
iodide of ethyl, etc., as C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>; so it really acts as a simple body or element,
though it is a compound of carbon and hydrogen. A simple radical is easily
understood; it is an element, like potassium, for instance. We may
now pass to the organic combinations classified into <span class="smcap">Acids</span>, <span class="smcap">Bases</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Indifferent</span>, or <span class="smcap">Neutral</span>, <span class="smcap">Bodies</span>.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">I. Acids.</span></p>

<p>There are several well-known organic acids, which we find in fruits and
in plants. They are volatile and non-volatile; acids are sometimes known
as “Salts of Hydrogen.” We have a number of acids whose names are
familiar to us,—viz., acetic, tartaric, citric, malic, oxalic, tannic, formic, lactic,
etc.</p>

<p><em>Acetic acid</em> (HC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a very important one, and is easily found
when vegetable juices, which ferment, are exposed to the air, or when wood
and other vegetable matter is subjected to the process of “dry distillation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>”
Vinegar contains acetic acid, which is distilled from wood, as we shall see
presently. Vinegar is made abroad by merely permitting wine to get sour;
hence the term <i lang="fr">Vin-aigre</i>. In England vinegar is made from “wort,” of
malt which is fermented for a few days, and then put into casks, the bung-holes
of which are left open for several weeks, until the contents have become
quite sour. The liquid is then cleared by isinglass. The vinegar of commerce
contains about 6 per cent. of pure acetic acid, and some spirit, some
colouring matter, and, of course, water. Wood vinegar (pyroligneous acid)
is used for pickles. The ordinary vinegar when distilled is called white
vinegar, and it may also be obtained from fruits, such as gooseberries or
raspberries.</p>

<p>Acetic acid, or “wood vinegar,” is prepared
as follows:—There are some large iron cylinders
set in brickwork over furnaces, and these cylinders
have each a tube leading to a main pipe in which
the liquid is received for condensation. The
cylinders, which contain about seven or eight
hundredweight, are filled with logs of wood, either
oak, beech, birch, or ash, the door is closely fastened,
and the joints smeared with clay; the fires are
now lighted and kept up all day, till the cylinders
are red-hot; at night they are allowed to cool. In
the morning, the charcoal, into which the wood is
now converted, is withdrawn, and a fresh charge
supplied; it is then found that about thirty or
forty gallons of liquid has condensed in the main
tube from each cylinder, the remainder being charcoal and gases which pass
off; the liquid is acid, brown, and very offensive, and contains acetic acid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
tar, and several other ingredients, among which may be named creosote;
it is from this source all the creosote, for the cure of toothache, is obtained.
To purify this liquid it is first distilled, and
this separates much of the tar; it is then
mixed with lime, evaporated to dryness, and
heated to expel the remaining tar and other
impurities; it is next mixed with sulphate
of soda and water, and the whole stirred together;
the soda, now in union with the
acetic acid, is washed out from the lime
and strained quite clear; it is afterwards
evaporated till it crystallises, and vitriol
(sulphuric acid) then added; finally the
acetic acid is distilled over, and the sulphuric acid left in union with the
soda, forming sulphate of soda, to be used in a similar process for the next
batch of acid. The acetic acid is now quite colourless, transparent, and very
sour, possessing a fragrant smell. This is not pure acetic acid, but contains
a considerable quantity of water. The acetic acid of commerce, mixed with
seven times its bulk of water, forms an acid of about the strength of malt
vinegar, perfectly wholesome, and agreeable as a condiment.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 422.—Vinegar-cooling process.</div>
</div>

<p>Pure acetic acid may be made by mixing dry acetate of potash with oil
of vitriol in a retort, and distilling the acetic acid into a very cold receiver;
this, when flavoured with various volatile oils, forms the aromatic vinegar
sold by druggists. It is a very strong acid, and if applied to the skin will
quickly blister it.</p>

<p>Acetate of lead, or sugar of lead, is obtained by dissolving oxide of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
lead in vinegar. A solution of this salt makes the goulard water so familiar
to all. Acetate of lead is highly poisonous.</p>

<p>Acetate of copper is <em>verdigris</em>, and poisonous. Other acetates are used
in medicine.</p>

<p>We may pass quickly over some other acids. They are as follows:—</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Tartaric Acid</span> (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) is contained in grape juice, and crystallizes
in tabular form. The purified powdered salt is cream of Tartar.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Citric Acid</span> (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) is found native in citrons and lemons, as well
as in currants and other fruits. It is an excellent anti-scorbutic.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Malic Acid</span> (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) is found chiefly in apples, as its name denotes
(malum, an apple). It is prepared from mountain-ash berries.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Oxalic Acid</span> (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). If we heat sugar with nitric acid we shall
procure this acid. It is found in sorrel plants.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Tannic Acid</span> (C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>17</sub>). It is assumed that all vegetables with an
astringent taste contain this acid. <em>Tannin</em> is known for its astringent
qualities. The name given to this acid is derived from the fact that it
possesses a property of forming an insoluble compound with water, known
as <em>leather</em>. Tanning is the term employed. <em>Tannin</em> is found in many
vegetable substances, but oak bark is usually employed, being the cheapest.
The “pelts,” hides, or skins, have first to be freed from all fat or hair by
scraping, and afterwards soaking them in lime and water. Then they are
placed in the tan-pit between layers of the bark, water is pumped in, and
the hides remain for weeks, occasionally being moved from pit to pit, or
relaid, so as to give all an equal proportion of pressure, etc. The longer
the leather is tanned—it may be a year—the better it wears.</p>

<p>Skins for gloves and binding are tanned with “sumach,” or alum and
salt. Sometimes the leather is split by machinery for fine working.
<em>Parchment</em> is prepared from the skins of asses, sheep, goats, and calves,
which are cleaned, and rubbed smooth with pumice stone.</p>

<p>Tannic acid, with oxide of iron, produces <em>Ink</em>, for the gall-nut contains
a quantity of the acid. All the black inks in use generally are composed of
green vitriol (sulphate of iron) in union with some astringent vegetable
matter; the best is the gall-nut, although, for cheapness, logwood and oak
bark have each been used. An excellent black ink may be made by
putting into a gallon stone bottle twelve ounces of bruised galls, six ounces
of green vitriol, and six of common gum, and filling up the bottle with rain
water; this should be kept three or four weeks before using, shaking the
bottle from time to time.</p>

<p>Blue ink has lately been much used; it is made by dissolving newly-formed
Prussian blue in a solution of oxalic acid. To make it, dissolve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
some yellow prussiate of potash in water in one vessel, and some sulphate
of iron in another, adding a few drops of nitric acid to the sulphate of iron;
now mix the two liquids, and a magnificent blue colour will appear, in the
form of a light sediment; this is to be put upon a paper filter, and well
washed by pouring over it warm water, and allowing it to run through; a
warm solution of oxalic acid should now be mixed
with it, and the Prussian blue will dissolve into a
bright blue ink.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_415a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 424.—Unhairing the hide.</div>
</div>

<p>Red ink is made by boiling chips or raspings of
Brazil wood in vinegar, and adding a little alum and
gum; it keeps well, and is of a good colour. A red
ink of more beautiful appearance, but not so durable,
may be made by dissolving a few grains of carmine in
two or three teaspoonfuls of spirit of hartshorn.</p>

<p>Marking ink is made by dissolving nitrate of
silver in water, and then adding some solution of
ammonia, a little gum water, and some Indian ink to colour it. Printers’
ink is made by grinding drying oil with lamp-black.</p>

<p>The powdered gall-nut is an excellent test for iron in water. It will
turn violet if any iron be present.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Formic Acid</span> (CH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is the
caustic means of defence employed
by ants, hence the term <em>formic</em>. It
can be artificially prepared by distilling
a mixture of sugar, binoxide
of manganese, and sulphuric acid.
On the skin it will raise blisters.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lactic Acid</span> (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is present
in vegetable and animal substances.
Sour whey contains it,
and the presence of the acid in
the whey accounts for its power of removing from table-linen stains.
When what is called “lactic fermentation” occurs, milk is said to be
“turned.”</p>


<p class="center">II.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Bases.</span></p>

<p>The definition of a base is not easy. We have described bases as
substances which, combining with acids, form salts, but the definition of a
base is as unsatisfactory as that of acid or salt. All vegetable bases contain
nitrogen, are usually very bitter, possess no smell or colour, and are insoluble
in water. They are usually strong poisons, but very useful in medicine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>

<p>The most important are the following bases:—</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Quinine</span> is contained in the cinchona (yellow) bark. One hundred
parts of the bark have been calculated to yield three of quinine.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Morphine</span> is the poisonous base of opium, which is the juice of the
poppy, and is prepared chiefly in India and China.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Nicotine</span> is the active principle of tobacco, and
varies in quantity in different tobaccos. Havannah
tobacco possesses the least. It is a powerful poison,
very oily, volatile, and inflammable.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Conia</span> is prepared from the hemlock. It is
fluid and volatile. It is also a deadly poison, and
paralyses the spine directly.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_416a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 426.—Hemlock.</div>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Strychnine</span> is found in poisonous trees, particularly
in the nux-vomica seeds of Coromandel. It
produces lock-jaw and paralysis. There is no antidote for strychnine;
emetics are the only remedy.</p>

<p>The above are chiefly remarkable for their uses in medicine, and in
consequence of their highly poisonous character
are best left alone by unpractised hands.</p>

<p>A German chemist, named Serturner, was
the first to extract the active principle from
Opium. The question of opium importation
has lately been attracting much attention,
and the opinions concerning its use are
divided. Probably in moderation, and when
used by ordinary people (not demoralized
creatures), it does little harm.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_416b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 427.—The Poppy.</div>
</div>

<p>Opium is the juice of the “common”
poppy, and derives its name from the Greek
<i lang="el">opos</i>, juice. The plant is cultivated in India,
Persia, and Turkey. After the poppy has
flowered the natives go round, and with a
sharp instrument wound, or puncture, every
poppy head. This is done very early in
the morning, and under the influence of the
sun during the day the juice oozes out.
Next morning the drops are scraped off.
The juice is then placed in pots, dried, and sent for export. The “construction”
of opium is very complicated, for it contains a number of ingredients,
the most important being morphia, narcotine, meconic acid, and
codeia. It is to the first named constituent that the somnolent effect of
opium is due.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">III.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Indifferent Substances.</span></p>

<p>There are a great number of so-called “indifferent” substances to which
we cannot be indifferent. Such bodies as these have neither acid nor basic
properties, and stand no comparison with salts. They are of great importance,
forming, as they do, the principal nutriment of animals. Some contain
nitrogen, some do not; they may therefore be divided into nitrogenous and
non-nitrogenous substances; the former for solid portions of the body, the
latter for warmth.</p>

<p>We will take the latter first, and speak of some of them—such as
starch, gum, sugar, etc.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Starch</span> is found in the roots
of grain, in the potato, dahlia, artichoke,
etc., and by crushing the
parts of the plant, and washing
them, the starch can be collected as
a sediment. In cold water and in
spirits of wine starch is insoluble.
The various kinds of starch usually
take their names from the plants
whence they come. Arrowroot is
obtained from the West Indian plant
<i>Maranta Arundinacea</i>. Cassava and
tapioca are from the manioc; sago,
from the sago palm; wheat starch,
and potato starch are other examples.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_417.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 428.—Plantation of sugar-canes.</div>
</div>

<p>If starch be baked in an oven
at a temperature of about 300°
it becomes, to a great extent,
soluble in cold water, forming what is called “British gum”; this is
largely used for calico printing and other purposes; if boiled in water
under great pressure, so that the temperature can be raised to the same
degree, it is also changed into an adhesive sort of gum, “mucilage”;
this is the substance made use of by the government officials to spread
over the backs of postage and receipt stamps to make them adhere.
The starch of grain, during germination, or growth, contains <em>diastase</em>, which
converts the starch into gum and sugar; the same effect can be produced
by heating starch with diluted sulphuric acid.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Gum</span> found in plants is chiefly procured from the Mimosa trees, from
which it flows in drops, and is called <em>Gum Arabic</em>. There are other
so-called “gums,” but this is the one generally referred to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sugar</span> exists in fruits, roots, and in the stalks of plants, in the juice
of the cane, maple, and beet-root particularly. The canes are crushed, the
juice is clarified with lime to prevent fermentation, and the liquid is
evaporated. It is then granulated and cleared from the molasses. Sugar,
when heated, becomes dark, and is called “caramel.” It is used for colouring
brandy, and gives much difficulty to the sugar refiners.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 431.—Turning the loaves.
</div>
</div>

<p>Sugar refining is conducted as follows. The raw (brown) sugar is mixed
into a paste with water, and allowed to drain. The sugar thus becomes
white. It is then dissolved in water, with animal charcoal and bullocks’
blood. The liquid is boiled, and put into a dark cistern with holes at the
bottom, and cotton fibres being fastened in the holes, are hung into another
dark cistern, into which the liquid runs pure and white. It is then pumped
into a copper vessel,—vacuum pan,—and condensed to the proper consistence.
Subsequently it
is poured into conical
moulds, and pure syrup
poured upon the crystal
shapes. The caramel is
then removed through a
hole at the end. The
moulds or loaves are then
dried, and if not even or
elegant they are turned
in a lathe. Finally they
are packed up as “loaf sugar.” Sugar undergoes no decomposition, and
is the cause of non-decomposition in other substances. For this reason it is
employed in “preserving” fruit, etc. Sugar is obtained from beet by crushing
and rasping the roots, as the cane is treated.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Spirit of Wine, or Alcohol</span>, is not a natural product. It is found
by the decomposition of grape-sugar by fermentation. There is a series of
alcohols which exhibit a regular gradation, founded, so to speak, upon one,
two, or three molecules of water. They are called respectively alcohols,
glycols, and glycerins. Thus we have—</p>

<ul class="table"><li><i>Alcohols.</i></li>

<li>Methylic alcohol.</li>
<li>Ethylic &nbsp;  “</li>
<li>Prophylic  &nbsp; “</li>
<li>Amylic    &nbsp;  “</li>

<li><i>Glycols.</i></li>

<li>Enthelein  glycol.</li>
<li>Prophylene  &nbsp; “</li>

<li>Amylene    &nbsp;  “</li>

<li><i>Glycerins.</i></li>

<li>(Ordinary Glycerine is the only one known.)</li></ul>

<p>The cetyl and melissylic alcohols are contained in spermaceti and bees-wax
respectively. The usual alcohol is the <em>Vinic</em>, a transparent, colourless liquid,
which is the spirituous principle of wine, spirits, and beer, and
when sugar is fermented the alcohol and carbonic acid remain.</p>

<p>Spirits of wine has a very powerful affinity for water, and
thus the use of stimulants in great quantity is to be deprecated,
for alcohol absorbs the water from the mucous membranes of
the stomach and the mouth, making them dry and hard. The state
of “intoxication,” unfortunately so familiar, is the effect produced
by alcohol upon the nerves. We append a list of the beverages
which are most in use, and the percentage of alcohol in each
according to Professor Hart:—</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 432.—Hydrometer.</div>
</div>

<p>Spirit of wine is contained in many mixtures, and for the purpose
of ascertaining how much alcohol may be in wine, or any other
liquid, a hydrometer is used (fig. 432). This instrument consists
of a glass tube with a bulb at the end. It is put into water, and
the place the water “cuts” is marked by a line on the stem,
and called zero 0°. Spirit of wine has less specific gravity than
water, so in absolute alcohol the instrument will sink lower than
in water, and will descend to a point which is marked 100. In
any mixture of alcohol and water, of course the hydrometer will
rise or sink between the extreme points accordingly as the mixture may
contain less alcohol or more. So a scale can be furnished. The instrument,
as described, was invented by MM. Gay-Lussac and Tralles, and called
the “percentage” hydrometer. There are many other instruments marked
in a more or less arbitrary manner. We append a comparative table
of a few hydrometers. (<i>See</i> <a href="#Page_420">page 420</a>.)</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ether</span>, or <em>sulphuric</em> ether, is a mixture of spirits of wine with sulphuric
acid, and distilled. It loses water, and the product is ether, which is volatile,
and transparent, with a peculiarly penetrating odour. It will not mix with
water, and if inhaled will produce a similar effect to chloroform.</p>

<p>Chloroform is transparent, and will sink in water. Diluted alcohol
with hypo-chloride of lime, will produce it. When inhaled, chloroform produces
a pleasing insensibility to pain, and is useful in surgery.</p>

<p>A certain compound of alcohol with mercury dissolved in nitric acid
will cause decomposition, and white crystals will eventuate. These compound
crystals are termed <em>fulminating mercury</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We must now pass rapidly over the few remaining subjects we have to
notice, such as fats and soaps, wax, oils, etc.</p>

<p>Fats are of the greatest use to man, particularly in cold climates, for upon
them depends the heat of the body. Fatty acid, if liquid, is known as oleic
acid; if solid, stearic acid. Soaps are compounds of fatty acids. Many
“fats” are consumed as food, others as fuel or for lighting purposes, in the
shape of oils. Such oils are not primarily useful for burning. Petroleum
and other mineral oils are found in enormous quantities in America.</p>

<p>There are what we term fixed oils, and essential or volatile oils. A
list is annexed as given by “Hadyn’s Dictionary of Science”:—</p>

<p>Vegetable oils are obtained by crushing seeds; animal oils come from
the whale and seal tribe. Paraffin oil comes from coal. Linseed is a very
drying oil, and on it depends the drying power of paint. We know olive
oil will not dry on exposure to the air. Oiled silk is made with linseed oil.
When oil is drying in the air considerable heat is evolved, and if oiled
substances be left near others likely to catch fire, spontaneous combustion
may ensue. Oil of turpentine is found in the pine
and fir trees, and many of the oils above mentioned
are used by perfumers, etc., the rose oil, or attar
of roses, being an Eastern compound.</p>

<p>Allied to the volatile oils are the <span class="smcap lowercase">RESINS</span>,
which are non-conductors of electricity. They
are vegetable products. They are soluble in
alcohol, in the volatile oils, or in ether, and these
solutions are called <em>varnishes</em>; the solvent evaporates
and leaves the coating. Turpentine, copal,
mastic, shellac, caoutchouc, and gutta-percha are
all resinous bodies. Amber is a mineral resin,
which was by the ancients supposed to be the
“tears of birds” dropped upon the seashore.
Moore refers to this in his poetic “Farewell to
Araby’s Daughter”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Around thee shall glisten the loveliest amber</div>
<div class="verse">That ever the sorrowing sea-bird has wept.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Amber is not soluble either in water or alcohol; it is, however, soluble
in sulphuric acid. It takes a good polish, and when rubbed is very electrical.
It is composed of water, an acid, some oil, and an inflammable gas,
which goes off when the amber is distilled.</p>

<p>The well-known camphor is got from a tree called the “Laurus Camphora”;
it is a white, waxy substance, and can be obtained by oxidizing
certain volatile oils. It is generally produced from the Laurus Camphora in a
“still.” The behaviour of a piece of camphor in pure water is curious, but
its motions can be at once arrested by touching the water or dropping oil on
the surface. This phenomenon is due to the surface tension of the liquid,
which diminishes when it is in contact with the vapour of the substance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Nitrogenous Substances.</span></p>

<p>There are certain albuminous compounds which we must mention here.
These are albumen, fibrine, and caseine. Albumen is the white of egg;
fibrine is, when solid, our flesh and muscular fibre, while caseine is the substance
of cheese. These are very important compounds, and the albuminous
bodies are of the very highest importance as food, for the solid
portion of blood, brain, and flesh consist, in a great measure, of them.
Albumen, fibrine, and caseine contain carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen,
with sulphur and phosphorus.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Albumen.</span> The most familiar and the almost pure form of albumen
is in the white of eggs, which is albuminate of sodium. It also exists in
the <em>serum</em> of the blood, and therefore it is largely found in the animal
kingdom. It can also be extracted from seed or other vegetable substances,
but it is essentially the same. Albumen is very useful as an antidote to
metallic poisons. It forms about 7 per cent. of human blood. It is soluble
up to about 140° Fah.; it then solidifies, and is precipitated in a white
mass. Albumen is used in the purification of sugar, etc.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fibrine</span> is found in a liquid condition in blood. The vegetable fibrine
(gluten) is prepared by kneading wheat flour in a bag till the washings are
no longer whitened. Like albumen it is found both in a solid and liquid
state.</p>

<p><em>Caseine</em> is seen in the skin which forms upon milk when heated, and
forms about 3 per cent. of milk, where it exists in a soluble state, owing to
the presence of alkali; but caseine, like albumen, is only soluble in alkaline
solutions. As we have said, it is the principal constituent of cheeses. Caseine
is precipitated by the <em>lactic</em> acid of milk, which is produced by keeping the
milk too warm. Caseine, or curds, as they are called, are thus precipitated.
The milk is said to be “sour,” or turned.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Milk</span>, the food of the young of all mammalia, is composed chiefly of
water, a peculiar kind of sugar, butter, and caseine. It is this sugar in milk
which causes the lactic acid mentioned above. The actual constituents of
milk are as follows:—</p>

<p>The sugar of milk is non-fermenting, and can be procured from whey by
evaporation.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Decomposition.</span></p>

<p>We have seen that animals and plants are composed of many different
substances, and so it will be at once understood that these substances can
be separated from each other, and then the decomposition of the body will be
completed. When the sap sinks or dries up in plants they are dead. When
our heart ceases to beat and our blood to flow we die, and then, gradually but
surely, decay sets in. There is no fuel left to keep the body warm; cold
results, and the action of oxygen of the air and light or water decays the
body, according to the great and unalterable laws of Nature. “Dust thou
art, and unto dust shalt thou return,” is an awful truth. The constituents
of our bodies must be resolved again, and the unfailing law of <em>chemical
attraction</em> is carried out, whereby the beautiful organism, deprived of the
animating principle, seeks to render itself into less complicated groups and
their primary elements.</p>

<p>This resolution of the organic bodies is decomposition, or “spontaneous
decomposition,” and is called decay, fermentation, or putrefaction, according to
circumstances. The Egyptians, by first drying the bodies of the dead (and
then embalming them), removed one great source of decay—viz., water, and
afterwards, by the addition of spices, managed to arrest putrefaction.</p>

<p>Fermentation is familiar in its results, which may be distilled for
spirituous liquors, or merely remain fermented, as beer and wine. Fusel oil is
prepared from potatoes, rum from cane sugar, arrack from rice. The power
of fermentation exists in nature everywhere, and putrefaction is considered
to be owing to the presence of minute germs in the atmosphere, upon which
Professors Tyndall and Huxley have discoursed eloquently.</p>

<p>Plants are subjected to a process of decomposition, which has been
termed “slow carbonization,” under certain circumstances which exclude
the air. The gases are given off, and the carbon remains and increases.
Thus we have a kind of moss becoming peat, brown coal, and coal. The
immense period during which some beds of coal must have lain in the ground
can only be approximately ascertained, but the remains found in the coal-measures
have guided geologists in their calculations.</p>

<p>Having already mentioned some products of distillation, we may now
close this portion of the subject and pass on to a brief consideration of
minerals and crystals. We have left many things unnoticed, which in the
limited space at our disposal we could not conveniently include in our sketch
of chemistry and chemical phenomena.</p>

<small>MINERALOGY AND CRYSTALLOGRAPHY.</small></h2>

<p class="hang">THE MINERALS—CHARACTERISTICS—CRYSTALS AND THEIR FORMS—DESCRIPTIONS
OF MINERALS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Minerals</span> are constituent parts of the earth. All parts of minerals are
alike. There are simple minerals and mixed. The former are the true
minerals, and are generally considered under the heading <span class="smcap">Mineralogy</span>.
The others constitute a branch of <span class="smcap">Geology</span>, as they form aggregate masses,
and as such compose a large portion of the earth. We must learn to
distinguish minerals and crystals as inorganic forms of nature. In the
animal and vegetable kingdoms we have forms which are possessed of organs
of sight, smell, taste, and certain structures indispensable to their existence
and development. But in minerals we have no such attributes. They are
<span class="smcap lowercase">INORGANIC</span>, and have a similar structure; a fragment will tell us the story
as well as a block of the same mineral. These inorganic substances are
possessed of certain attributes or characteristics. We find they have <span class="smcap lowercase">FORM</span>.
They have chemical properties, and they behave differently when exposed
to light and electricity. They are generally solid. All the elements are
found in the mineral kingdom, and a mineral may be an element itself, or a
chemical combination of elements. These compounds are classed according
as the combination is more or less simple. An alliance of two elements is
termed a <em>binary</em> compound, of three a <em>ternary</em> compound, forming a base
and an acid.</p>

<p>We have learnt from our chemistry paper that there are between sixty
and seventy elementary bodies in nature. When we speak of “elements,”
we do not mean to apply the popular and erroneous definition of the word.
Earth, air, fire, and water are not elements; they are compounds, as we
have seen. The list of elements has been given; we will now give the
names of the more important minerals. We have no space for a detailed
description, but in the British Museum the cases contain some hundreds,
and the student will find them classified and described with the greatest
care, and according to the arrangement of Berzelius.</p>

<p>These are only a portion of the minerals, but it would be scarcely interesting
to give the list at greater length. In the foregoing we recognize the
metals and various combustible and non-combustible substances familiar to
us, existing, as people say sometimes, in “lumps.” But if any one will take
the trouble to examine a “lump,” he will find the shape is definite and
even. These regular forms of the minerals are called <span class="smcap lowercase">CRYSTALS</span>, from the
Greek word krustallos, <em>ice</em>. The term was originally applied to quartz, for
in olden times it was thought that quartz was really congealed water. We
can define a crystal as “an inorganic solid bounded by plane surfaces
arranged round imaginary lines known as <em>axes</em>.” It must not be imagined
that crystals are small bodies; they may be of any size. There are crystals
of many hundredweight; and although the usual crystal is comparatively
small, it may be any size.</p>

<p>Crystallization has occurred by cooling, or by other natural means;
and we can form crystals by evaporation from certain salts deposited in
water. So we may conclude also that the evaporation of water in the early
periods deposited many forms of crystals. We have crystals in the air, such
as snowflakes, which are vapours crystallized. Carbon, when crystallized, is
the diamond. Boron is very like it. Oxygen cannot be crystallized.
Alumina makes sapphires and ruby with silica. Alumina and earth give
us spars, tourmaline, and garnets. Limestone also has beautiful forms, as
in Iceland spar. Crystals, therefore, are certain forms of nature, corresponding
in the inorganic kingdom to the animals and plants of the organic.</p>

<p>Let us look a little more at these. Here we have a group of crystals
of different forms. Earths are metals combined with oxygen, and the
principal earths are alumina, lime, and silica. To these three we are chiefly
indebted for the ground we live on, and from which we dig so many useful
metals and other minerals. Earths are coloured by the substances mixed
with them. We can thus find copper, silver, gold, lead, etc., by noting the
appearance of the soil. True earths are white. Strontia and baryta are
also earths, and the latter is used in firework manufactories. Our chief
assistants are <span class="smcap">Alumina</span>, which furnishes us with bricks and slate; <span class="smcap">Lime</span>,
which gives us marble or stones for building in a carbonate form. Quicklime,
by which is meant lime freed from the carbonic acid, is well known;
and plaster of Paris is only lime and sulphuric acid in combination. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Silicates</span>, such as sand and flint, are in daily demand. Agate, cornelian,
Scotch pebbles, rock-crystal, etc., belong to the same family. Even our
gems are crystallized earths, and, as already stated, diamonds are merely
carbon.</p>

<p>Stone, as we know, is quarried; that is, it is dug out of the earth.
But perhaps many readers do not know why a stone-mine is called a
“quarry.” Most kinds of stone (granite and marble are the exceptions) are
found in layers, or strata, rendering them easy of removal. The blocks of
stone are cut with reference to these layers in a more or less square manner,
and “squared up” before they are carried away. Thus the term “quarry,”
from an old French word, <i lang="fr">quarré</i>, or <i lang="fr">carré</i>, as now written, signifying a
square. In granite quarries the stone being very hard is bored, and loosened
by means of gunpowder or dynamite blasting. Slate, on the contrary, is
easily divided into slabs. We will now resume the subject of Crystals.</p>

<p>We have said that crystals vary in size, and this variety may be traced,
in the cases of crystallization from fluids, to the slowness or the rapidity of
the cooling process. If the work be done slowly, then the crystals obtain a
size commensurate with the time of cooling, as they are deposited one upon
the other. The form of minerals is the first important point, and to ascertain
their forms and structure we must study <span class="smcap">Crystallography</span>. We
shall find faces, or <em>planes</em>,—the lines of contact of any two planes,—called
<em>edges</em>, and the <em>angles</em> formed where these planes meet. We may add that
crystals have, at least, four planes, making six edges and four angles. Nearly
all crystals have more than this, for the forms are, if not infinite, very
numerous, and are divided into six (by some writers into seven) different
systems or fundamental forms from which the varieties are derived. The axis
of a crystal is an imaginary line drawn from an angle to the opposite one.</p>

<p>The first form, the <em>monometric, or cubic system</em>, with three equal axes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
at right angles, is represented by fig. 436. This crystal is limited by eight
equilateral triangles. It has twelve edges and six angles. If we describe a
line from any one angle to an opposite one, that line is called an <em>axis</em>, and
in the case before us there are three such axes, which intersect each other at
right angles.<a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Such crystals are regular octohedra. There are irregular
forms also, whose axes do not come at right angles, or they may be of
unequal length. The substances which we find crystallized in this form or
system are the diamond, nearly all metals, chloride of sodium (salt), fluor-spar,
alum, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 435.—Stone quarry.</div>
</div>

<p>When we say in this form we do not mean that all the minerals are
shaped like the illustration (fig. 436). We shall at once see that the
system admits of other shapes. For instance, a regular
crystal may have been cut or rubbed (and the experiment
can be made with a raw turnip). Suppose we cut
off the angles in fig. 436; we then shall have a totally
different appearance, and yet the crystal is the same, and
by cutting that down we can obtain a cube (fig. 437).
Take off its angles again we obtain a regular octohedron
once more, as shown in the diagram opposite.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_428b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 436.—Regular octahedron—first system.</div>
</div>

<p>We will exhibit the gradations. Suppose we cut
fig. 437; we will obtain (fig. 438) the cube. The next is
merely the cube with angles and edges cut off; and if we proceed regularly
we shall arrive at fig. 442, the rhombic dodecahedron, or twelve-sided
figure, whose equal planes are rhombs.</p>

<p>We can, by taking away alternate angles or edges situated opposite,
arrive at other secondary crystals. From the original octohedron we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
thus obtain figs. 443 and 444. These are known as <em>tetrahedron</em>. The
<em>pentagonal dodecahedron</em> is another secondary form (fig. 445).</p>

<p>The cube, or hexahedron, the octohedron, and the rhombohedron are all
simple forms, being each bounded by equal and similar faces, or surfaces. We
can thus understand how certain primary or original natural forms of crystals
can be changed in appearance by connection. Of the various substances
crystallizing in this system we find salt, iron pyrites, gold, silver, copper,
and platinum, and the sulphide of lead called <em>galena</em>, in the cube or hexahedron
form. The diamond and fluor-spar, alum, etc., appear in the first
form (I), fig. 436 (octohedron). The cube, we see, has six equal <em>faces</em>, eight
equal <em>angles</em>, and twelve equal <em>edges</em>. Galena, as will be observed from the
illustration herewith, shows this peculiarity in a very marked manner (fig. 446).</p>

we have three axes differing in length, and all forms which can be arranged
about these unequal and oblique axes. Sulphate of copper will be found
in this group. The system has been called anorthic, or
triclinic, because the axes are unequal and inclined, as in
the oblique prism based upon an obliqued angled parallelogram.

in this system.</p>

</div>

<p>As may be gathered from the foregoing, it is not easy
to determine a crystalline form with certainty,—a great part
of the crystal may be invisible. A crystalline mass is a
mineral, which consists of an arrangement of crystals heaped
together. If it does not possess these the mineral is
<em>amorphous</em>, or shapeless. We will now endeavour to describe some of the
physical characteristics of minerals.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_431b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 455.—Wollaston’s Goniometer, an instrument for measuring the angles of crystals.</div>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Goniometer</span> (<i>see</i> fig. 455) is the instrument used for measuring
the angles of crystals. Wollaston’s reflecting instrument is most generally
used. It consists of a divided circle, graduated to degrees, and subdivided
with the vernier. The manner of working is easy, though apparently complicated.
The vernier is brought to zero, when an object is reflected in one
face of the crystal. The crystal is turned till the same object is viewed from
another face. The angle of reflection is then measured, and can be read off
on the circle.</p>

<p>We have already referred to the physical characteristics of the minerals,
and one of these attributes is <em>cohesion</em>. When we find a substance is difficult
to break, we say it is “hard.” This means that the cohesion of the different
particles is very great. Minerals vary in hardness; some are extremely
difficult to act upon by force, and a file appears useless. At the other side
we find some which can be pricked or scratched with a pin; and these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
degrees of hardness being put as extremes, we can in a manner relatively
estimate the hardness of all other minerals. We can test this by scratching
one against another; whichever scratches the other is the harder of the two,
and thus by taking up and discarding alternately, we can at length arrive
at a comparative estimate of the hardness of all. Such a scale was arrived at
by Mohs, and arranged in the following order. The softest mineral comes
first:—</p>


<ol class="table"><li> Talc.</li>
<li> Gypsum (rock-salt).</li>
<li> Calcareous spar.</li>
<li> Fluor-spar.</li>
<li> Apatite-spar.</li>
<li> Felspar.</li>
<li> Quartz.</li>
<li> Topaz.</li>
<li> Corundum.</li>
<li> Diamond.</li></ol>



<p>Talc, we see, is the softest, and diamond the hardest. Thus “diamond cut
diamond” has passed into a proverb expressive of the difficulties one “sharp”
person has to circumvent or “cut out” another. Diamond is used by glass-cutters.
When geologists wish to express the degree of hardness of any
substance, they mention it with reference to the foregoing list; and if the
substance be harder than fluor-spar, but not so hard as felspar, they determine
its hardness five, or perhaps between five and six, or between four and five,
according as it is harder or less hard than apatite. Thus hardness, or power
of cohesion, resistance to exterior force and pressure, is a prime characteristic
of the mineral kingdom. The file is the best test.</p>

<p>We now come to another phase of the physical character of our
minerals—<em>cleavage</em>. This is the term employed to express the facility of
cutting in a certain direction which in the mineral is its direction of cleavage.
Take mica, for instance. There is no difficulty in separating mica into
thin layers; we can do so with our fingers. The layers, or flakes, or
laminæ are so arranged that they exhibit less cohesion in one direction than
when tried in other ways. We cut with the grain, as it were in the direction
of the fibre when wood is concerned. Here we have another popular saying
expressive of this,—“against the grain,”—which signifies an act performed
unwillingly and unpleasantly. Cleavability, therefore, means cutting with
the grain, as it were, and various minerals are possessed of different degrees
of cleavage. It sometimes happens that electric excitement is observed
when cleavage takes place. One place will become positive, and the other
negative. Mica, arragonite, and calcareous spar will exhibit this action after
cleavage or pressure. When a crystal of tourmaline is heated, it will
develop positive electricity at one end of its principal axis, and negative at
the other. Even if it be broken, the extremities of the fragments will
exhibit similar phenomena, and so far like a magnet, which, as we have
seen, possesses this attribute of “polarity.” But a curious fact in connection
with this is that, if the heating cease the polarity ceases for a second or two,
and yet as cooling goes on the polarity is restored, with the difference that
the positive end has become negative, and the end previously negative has
come over to the opposite pole. Electricity, therefore, must be hidden away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
in every portion of our globe, and will some day be proved to be the mainspring
of all life.</p>

<p><em>Fracture</em> in minerals is also to be noticed. Those substances which
we cannot laminate we are obliged to break, and we may require to break
a mineral in a direction different from or opposed to its direction of
cleavage. Under such circumstances we must break it, disintegrate it, and
observe the fracture. Sometimes we shall find the surfaces very even, or
uneven, or what is termed <em>conchoidal</em>. This is observable in the breaking
of flint. There are various ways in which minerals display fracture, and
the particular manner and appearance denotes the class to which the mineral
belongs.</p>

<p>We may pass over the question of the specific gravity of minerals, as
we have in a former part explained this. It is important, however, to
ascertain the specific gravity. As a general rule, minerals containing heavy
metals are of high specific gravity.</p>

<p>But the relation of minerals (crystals) with regard to light is of great
interest and importance. When we were writing of polarization, we mentioned
the faculty a crystal has for double refraction, by which it divides a
ray of light into two prolonged rays taking different directions, the plane of
vibration of one being at right angles to that of the other. This property
is not possessed by all crystals. Some act as ordinary transparent media.
Some crystals transmit only one polarized ray, and tourmaline is called a
polarizer; and if light be passed through it to another polarizer, it will be
transmitted if the latter be similarly held; but if the second be held at right
angles to it the ray will be stopped. We can easily understand this if we
suppose a grating through which a strip of tin is passed; but the strip will
be stopped by bars at right angles to it. The coloured rings in crystals
can be observed when a slice of a double refracting crystal is examined.
The rings are seen surrounding a black cross in some instances, and a white
cross in another. The effect when examined in the polariscope is very
beautiful. Selenite is probably the best crystal for exhibiting colours.</p>

<p>Minerals sometimes reflect, sometimes refract light; they are said to
possess lustre and phosphorescence. All these properties may be considered
as belonging to the crystals which are transparent, semi-transparent, translucent,
or opaque, according to the degrees in which they permit light to
pass through them. All minerals are electric or non-electric, and the variety
can be ascertained by rubbing and placing the mineral near the electrometer.
But all do not exhibit magnetic properties. Taste and smell are strongly
marked in some minerals—salts, for instance, and sulphur; some are soapy to
the touch, some appear cold to the fingers. Chemistry is very useful to us in
determining the nature of the mineral, and the amount of it enclosed in the substance
under examination. These delicate operations are termed qualitative
and quantitative analysis. The application of heat is increased by means of
the blowpipe, which is in effect a small bellows. We can thus, and particularly
by means of the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe, obtain a very intense heat with little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
trouble. When the fragments of a mineral are held in the flame by platinum
“tweezers,” or tongs, then the <em>fusibility</em> of the substance, and the colour of
the blow-pipe flame will be of great assistance in determining the nature of
the mineral. It is also curious to observe the different forms into which the
various substances expand or contract under the influence of the blowpipe.
We may have a rugged slag, an enamel, or a glass, or a bead, or “drop” of
metal. The varied substances produce various colours—yellow, green, orange,
or red, according to circumstances. Strontia is a vivid red, copper is green,
lime orange, and so on.</p>

<p>It is very little use to attempt a study of mineralogy without some
acquaintance with chemistry. In dealing with minerals, and in studying
geology, we must try to keep our knowledge of chemical science in our
minds, and thus fortified we can more easily understand the steps leading to
the classification of minerals. It is impossible to teach mineralogy or geology
from books. Nature must be studied, the specimens must be seen, the
earth must be examined. The advance in mineralogy may be—probably
will be—slow, but crystals will teach something; and when we can pass a
<i lang="la">viva voce</i> examination in chemistry and crystallography, expressing, by the
symbols, the various substances under discussion, we shall have made a
considerable advance in the science. We shall have an idea of the component
parts of various substances, and be able to class the various minerals
according to their chemical constitution. Beginning with the metalloids, we
shall pass to the metals and various compounds, salts, resinous substances,
etc., such as amber.</p>

<p>It is impossible in the space at our command to describe all the
minerals, and yet it is necessary to enumerate the most important. We
may, therefore, take them in the following order. It should be added that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
most of the simple minerals occur in comparatively small quantities, but
sometimes we find them in aggregate masses (rocks). We append a table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sulphur</span> is found in Sicily and Italy and other parts of Europe, in a
native state, but as such has to be purified.
The crystals take the form as shown in
the margin. Cleavage imperfect; it is brittle.
Sulphuric acid is a very important combination,
and a very dangerous one in inexperienced
hands. Sulphur combines with a
number of elements, which combinations
are “Sulphides.” (<i>See</i> <a href="#Page_307">Chemistry section</a>.)</p>

<div class="figright" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 457.—Crystals of sulphur.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Selenium</span> is a metalloid resembling
sulphur, but less common. It is inodorous.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Boron</span> is usually found near volcanic springs, and in combination with
oxygen. It is soluble. Taste, acid bitter, and white in colour; friable. It
is known as <span class="smcap">Sassoline</span>, or boracic acid. (<i>See</i> <a href="#Page_386">Biborate of Soda</a> for one of
the borates.)</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Carbon</span> is one of the most important of our minerals. In the form
of coal we have it in daily use, and in the form of diamond it is our most
valuable gem. In the latter form it is the hardest of all minerals, a
powerful refractor of light, lustrous, and transparent. It is found in the East
Indies and Brazil; more lately Cape diamonds have been brought to Europe,
but they do not equal the Eastern gem. Almost fabulous prices have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
given for diamonds, which, after all, are only carbon in a pure state. Another
form of carbon is <em>graphite</em> (plumbago, or blacklead). It is much used for
pencils and in households. It is found in Cumberland, and in many other
localities in Europe and Canada.</p>

<p>Carbon appears in one or other of the above forms in regular octahedrons
or their allied shapes. <em>Anthracite</em>, another form of carbon, is used
as fuel for strong furnaces. It leaves little “ash,” and is smokeless when
burned. <em>Coal</em>, in all its forms, is evidently derived from wood. Thousands
of years ago vegetable matter must have been embedded in the ground and
subjected to carbonization. There are different kinds of coal, all of which
come under one or other of the following heads: cubical coal, slate coal,
cannel coal, glance-lignite,—the last being, as its name implies, an imperfect
development of wood; it is a brown coal. We are not here concerned with
coal as a fuel. Charcoal is also a form of carbon prepared from wood and
finds a counterpart in coke, which is prepared from coal. Carbon, as we have
already seen, plays an important part in electric lighting and in the Voltaic
Battery. Peat, or as it is called in Ireland, “turf,” is one of the most recent
of the carboniferous formations. It is much used as fuel. It is cut from
moors (“bogs,” as they are sometimes called), and the various deposits can
be traced. Bog-oak is no doubt the first step towards peat, as peat is the
step towards coal. The brown turf is newer than the black, and both kinds
may be seen stacked in small square “bricks” along the Irish canals and in
the yards of retailers of fuel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silicon.</span> Silica occurs generally in combination with alumina, and
never in a free state. In combination with oxygen it is called silicic acid.
Silica, when crystallized, is usually called <em>quartz</em>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Quartz</span> has several varieties. We need only enumerate them, they
will all be immediately recognized. We give illustrations of the crystals of
quartz (fig. 459):—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Rock crystal appears in beautiful six-sided prisms.</p>

<p>2. Amethyst is coloured by protoxide of manganese, supposed by the ancients to be a
charm against drunkenness.</p>

<p>3. Common quartz, or quartz rock, forms granite in combination, and is also known as
“cat’s-eye,” “rose” quartz, etc.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span></p>
<p>4. Chalcedony, sometimes termed <em>cornelian</em>: used for seals, etc.</p>

<p>5. Flint: much used in potteries. “Flint and steel” have been superseded by phosphorus.</p>

<p>6. Hornstone: something like flint, resembling horn.</p>

<p>7. Jasper: of various colours; opaque and dull in appearance.</p>

<p>8. Silicious slate: a combination; used as a whetstone.</p>

<p>9. Agate: a mixture of quartz, amethyst, jasper, and cornelian; very ornamental.</p>

<p>10. Opal: a peculiar variety, containing water. It is not found in the form of crystal,
but in vitreous masses. Its changeableness of hue is proverbial. The “noble” opal is
much prized.</p>

<p>11. Smoky quartz, or cairngorm.</p>

<p>12. Onyx and Sardonyx.</p></blockquote>

<p>We now arrive at some minerals which contain metals.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Potassium.</span> This metal is so frequently combined in minerals with
alumina that we may refer to it with the latter in sequel. There are two
natural potassa salts—nitre, and sulphate of potassa. Nitre is known as
saltpetre, and is of great use in medicine. It is the chief ingredient in the
composition of gunpowder.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sodium.</span> We have a number of minerals in this group—viz., <em>nitrate of
soda</em> (nitratine), which occurs in large quantities in Peru; <em>rock salt</em>, chloride
of sodium, known as salt. It crystallizes in the cubic system. Colour
usually white, but it occurs in secondary rocks in company with gypsum,
etc. It is sometimes of a reddish colour, or even green and yellow. Biborate
of soda is <em>borax</em>, and is found in and on the borders of a Thibetian lake. There
are several other combinations with soda: the sulphates of soda—viz.,
thenardite and glauberite, anhydrous and hydrated respectively,
carbonate of soda, and so on.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ammonia</span> combinations occur in lava fissures, and are not
often met with in consequence of their volatile nature.</p>


<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_437b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 460.—Spar crystal.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Calcium.</span> This forms an important group of the minerals,
which are very white in colour, and not very hard in substance.
Calcium is the metallic basis of lime. Fluoride of calcium, known as
<em>fluor-spar</em>, most frequently crystallizes in cubes in the first system. <em>Anhydrite</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
is the anhydrous sulphate of calcium. The hydrated sulphate is called gypsum.
One variety of the hydrated sulphate is selenite, another is known as alabaster.
Apatite, or asparagus stone, and pharmacolite are in this group.</p>

<p class="center"><small><b>Fig. 461.—<span class="smcap">Crystals of Carbonate of Lime</span></b></small>.</p>
</div>

<p><em>Carbonate of lime</em>, not content with one system of crystals, makes its
appearance in two. It is therefore divided into two minerals—namely, <em>calcareous
spar</em> and <em>arragonite</em>. In the former it possesses various forms, as will
be observed in the accompanying diagrams. It is a very important mineral,
as will be readily acknowledged; it enters largely into the composition of
all shells and bones. The minute shells, deposited by millions at the bottom
of the sea, have combined to raise our chalk cliffs. Carbonate of lime is a
constituent of water, as the deposits at the bottoms of kettles, upon the sides
and bottoms of water-bottles, and the stalactites all testify. A little good
vinegar will quickly dissolve this deposit. Calc-spar is crystallized, and the
Iceland spar is celebrated. Marble, which is another form of carbonate of
lime, is white, hard, and granular. It is sometimes varied, but the pure
white is the most valuable. Chalk, we know well, is soft, and is useful for
writing. We have also <em>aphrite</em>, schiefer spar,—compact limestone in various
forms,—and finally, <em>arragonite</em>, called from the place of its nativity, Arragon,—a
colourless and somewhat transparent vitreous crystal.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Barytes.</span> The sulphate of baryta is known as
<em>heavy spar</em>; the crystals are of tabular forms, but
numerous modifications exist. One of the forms is
represented in the margin.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_438bx.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 462.—Tabular form of heavy spar.</div>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Strontium</span> is the metallic basis of strontia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
Sulphate of strontium is <em>celestine</em>, the mineral which colours the blow-pipe
flame a fine crimson. There are certain varieties. Strontia salts are chemical
preparations. A beautiful pyrotechnic “red fire” is produced by mixing
nitrate of strontia with sulphur, antimony, charcoal, and chlorate of potassia.<a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
There is a carbonate of strontia in the same crystalline system.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Magnesium.</span> With this metal we have a large group of minerals.
<em>Magnesite</em> is carbonate of magnesia, and occurs as talc-spar. The magnesium
limestone crystallizes as <em>bitter spar</em>. This dolomite is like
marble or common limestone, according to colour. Talc is
a combination of magnesia with silicic acid. The hydrated
carbonate is termed “white magnesia.” The sulphate of
magnesia is found in Siberia, and we have <em>boracite</em>, and
native magnesia called <em>periclase</em>. The sulphate is generally
present in mineral waters, such as the Seidlitz and Epsom
Springs. Large masses have been found in the extensive
caverns of Kentucky and Tennessee, etc.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_439a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 463.—Crystal of augite.</div>
</div>

<p><em>Meerschaum</em> is a hydrated silicate of magnesia. It is
found in Anatolia and Negropont, also in France and Australasia. Serpentine
is another similar composition. It is found in Cornwall, where it is carved
into various ornaments. It is sometimes called snakestone. There are
many other hydrated silicates of magnesia—viz., gymnite, picrosmine,
pycrophyll, etc.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_439b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 464.—Alum crystals.</div>
</div>

<p>There is another family allied to magnesia, called <span class="smcap">Augites</span>. These
minerals are black or dark-green, and are contained in lava and basalt:
<span class="smcap">Augite</span> and <span class="smcap">Hornblende</span> are the chief representatives of this family. The
former crystallizes in the fourth system (<i>see</i> fig. 463), and there are several
varieties—diallage, bronzite, diopside, etc. <span class="smcap">Hornblende</span> belongs to the
same system, and is a large factor in the composition of gneiss, syenite,
and porphyry. <em>Tremolite</em> is a
hornblende, and <em>asbestos</em> (<em>amianthos</em>),
and <em>mountain-cork</em> are also
varieties. The attribute of asbestos
for sustaining heat is well
known, and may be usefully employed
for fire-proof purposes.
The well-known <em>jade-stone</em> of
China and <em>calamite</em> are other
varieties.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Aluminum</span>, or <span class="smcap">Aluminium</span>,
gives us a large class of
minerals. It is the metallic
basis of alumina, which, com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>bined
with silica, is the chief component of our clay. Silicic acid and this
base combine to form many minerals, and contains nearly all the precious
stones. <em>Corundums</em> consist of pure alumina, and crystallize in the hexagonal
system. The following stones are varieties of this mineral:—<em>Sapphire</em>, a
beautiful blue; <em>ruby</em>, a red oriental; <em>topaz</em>, yellow oriental; <em>amethyst</em>, violet;
all being sapphires more or less. The finest crystals are found in the East
Indies in the sands of rivers and diluvial soils. The <em>common corundum</em> is
very hard, and is used for polishing. <em>Emery</em> is well known, and is found
in mica-slate. It is of a bluish-grey colour, and is also a polisher.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Alum</span> forms another family, of which we may first mention aluminite,
a “basic sulphate” of alumina and found in small quantities. <em>Alum-stone</em> is
found in Italy. <em>Alum</em> occurs in large crystallized masses. (<i>See</i> illustration,
fig. 464.) There are different minerals with a composition very similar to
alum, in which the potassa base of alum is supplied by others. Thus we
have the potassa alum, soda alum, manganese alum, ammonia alum—all
being very nearly of the same constituents, and having similar crystals
in the regular system, and are thus termed isomorphous, or similarly-formed.
The potassa, or potash alum, is the commonest form, and is found abundantly
in England, on the Continent of Europe, and the United States. Soda
alum is called <em>salfatarite</em>, and magnesia alum <em>pickeringite</em>; manganese
alum is <em>apjohnite</em>; phosphate of alumina is <em>wavellite</em>.</p>

<p>There are compounds of alumina and magnesia called <span class="smcap">Spinels</span>. They
are hard minerals, and the same isomorphous changes take place with them as
are observable with the bases of alum. There are therefore varieties such
as the <em>spinel ruby</em> found in the East Indies, very red in colour; the <em>balas
ruby</em> not so red, and the orange-red, termed <em>rubicelle</em>. Ceylon is remarkable
for some fine specimens of spinels. <em>Chromite</em> is like the spinel, but is known
as chrome iron.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Zeolites</span> are principally compositions of silica and alumina. They
contain water, and are white, vitreous, and transparent. There are several
varieties of them—natrolite, stilbite, etc. We will now pass on to the <em>Clays</em>,
which are a very important family of the aluminum group.</p>

<p>There are a number of hard minerals which, when disintegrated, form
certain earthy masses. These we term clay, or clays, which possess various
colours and receive certain names, according to the proportion of metallic
oxides they contain. All clays have an affinity for water, and retain it to a
very great extent. The earth has also a peculiar smell. Clay is used in
various ways; pottery, for instance, we read in the Bible as having been an
employment from very ancient times. One attribute of clays, the retention
of water, is of the greatest use to the world in providing moisture for plants
and seeds. We may mention other characteristics of clay. It absorbs oil
very quickly, and therefore is useful for removing grease-spots. It cannot
be burned, so we have fire-bricks and fire-clay in our stoves and furnaces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
There are various clays—pipe-clay, for instance, which is white; potters’ clay
is coarser. There is porcelain clay as well as porcelain earth, of which
more below. <em>Yellow ochre</em> and <em>sienna</em> are clays used by artists. <em>Bole</em> is a
reddish clay; and <em>tripoli</em> is employed for polishing. There are, besides,
<em>andalusite</em>, or chiastolite and disthene, crystalline forms of clay.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Porcelain has been known to the Chinese for centuries. In
1701 it was discovered in Germany by Böttcher, a chemist, who while
endeavouring to make gold by Royal command, found the porcelain, and
was thereby enriched. Porcelain earth is frequently found; is known in
many places as kaolin, and usually comes from the decomposition of
felspar. But in Cornwall we find it as decomposed granite, and the filtering
process can be viewed from the railway, while both gneiss and granulite
have been known to yield kaolin. It is also found in China, Saxony, and
France. It is free from iron, and when ground and mixed with silicic acid,
it is handed to the potter or moulder. After the vessels have been dried in
the air they are put into the kiln, and then become white and hard. After
that they are glazed in a mixture of porcelain earth and gypsum, or ground
flints and oxide of lead, made fluid with water in the glazing of earthenware.
The vessel is then put into the furnace again, or “fired,” as the process is
called, and then comes out white, hard, and partly transparent.</p>

<p>Earthenware utensils are made of a coarser material,—clay and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
powdered flints,—from which all the gross matter has been eliminated.
Flint is not difficult to break, if made hot and thrown into cold water. A
stamper is then used to break the flints. They are first ground in a mill and
purified like the clay, then they are
mixed and beaten, while moist,
into “putty,” and turned, or forced,
into moulds. The handles are fixed
on afterwards. The ware is baked
for two days and glazed. The
various colours are obtained by mixing
different clays and oxides—iron or manganese. Biscuit
porcelain is made by pouring a creamy mixture of porcelain
earth into plaster-of-Paris moulds, and when a thin case has
formed within, the liquid is poured out again. It is then
dried in the mould and shrinks. The mould is taken to pieces, and the
thin biscuit porcelain is left.</p>

<img src="images/i_442c.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 468.—Felspar.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Felspars</span> are very like the zeolites, except that the former contain no
water. Felspar crystallizes in a number of different forms. We
annex illustrations of specimens. This spar is found in rocks,
granite, gneiss, etc. One variety is the <em>moonstone</em>, of a peculiar
lustre. Felsite is amorphous felspar. <em>Albite</em> contains soda
instead of potash. <em>Labradorite</em> is nearly a pure lime felspar, and
is remarkable for its colours, like a pigeon’s breast. <em>Spodumene</em>
is like albite, and leucite, soda-lite, etc., belong to this family.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_442d.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 469.—Felspar crystal.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lapis-Lazuli</span> is a felspar distinguished by its blue tint.
It was used for ultramarine colouring at one time, which
colour can also be made chemically. Lapis-lazuli is
found in Siberia and China. It is a mixture of
mineral species. <em>Hauyne</em> is something like it. <em>Obsidian</em>
is a sort of black glass, and occurs in various
colours in vitreous masses. It is derived from the
fusion of rocks, and is employed in the manufacture
of boxes, etc. <em>Pumice stone</em> bears a resemblance in
composition to the foregoing, but is porous, and so
called spongy. It contains both potash and soda in
some quantities. <em>Pearlstone</em> and <em>pitchstone</em> also attach
themselves to this family group.</p>


<p>The <span class="smcap">Garnets</span> possess many curious forms of crystals, which are
coloured and used as gems. <em>Tourmaline</em> is a very particularly useful
crystal, and is used in the investigations concerning the polarization of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
light. It is found of nearly all colours. The garnet and staurolite crystals
are shown (figs. 470, 471).</p>

<p>The former is silicate of alumina with the silicate of some other oxide,
which is not always the same. This change, of course, gives us a series, as in
the case of <em>alum</em> above mentioned.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_443a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 470.—Garnet crystal.</div>
</div>

<p>The red varieties, called <em>almandine</em>, or precious
garnets, are distinguished from the duller, “common”
species by their clear colour. Bohemia is the most
productive soil for the garnets.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mica</span> includes, as we have already noticed, a group
of minerals which have a peculiarly <em>laminated</em> structure.
These layers are by no means all alike, but they present
a smoothness to the fingers which is highly characteristic. The chief constituents
are alumina and silica, occasionally with magnesia. Mica slate is
very common, and is often used instead of glass in window-frames. <em>Muscovite</em>,
<em>lepidolite</em>, and <em>phlogopite</em> are all micas of the “potash,” “lithia,” and
“magnesia” varieties.</p>

<p>In the list of minerals associated with the lighter metals, we need only
now mention the <em>Gems</em>, so well known. These stones are very hard in
many instances, infusible, and exhibiting beautiful
colours. Amongst them are diamonds, sapphires, and
rubies, of which we have spoken; the topaz, noticed
under corundum. The chrysoberyl (of a pale green, or
occasionally reddish hue), of which the alexandrite of
Siberia is a variety, is a compound of glucina with
alumina; the beryl, a silicate of the same, and the
emerald of beautiful green. Zircon is another gem, and
“hyacinth” is its most valued form. The latter is
found in basaltic rocks. The emerald crystallizes in the hexagonal
system.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 471.—Staurolite crystal.</div>
</div>

<p>We may now consider the minerals formed by the heavier metals, such
as Iron, Copper, Nickel, etc.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Iron.</span> This well-known metal fills a very important place in our
mineral arrangements, for the substances formed with iron ores occur in
great variety of structure, and occasionally in very large masses. They are
highly magnetic, and very hard. Were we here treating of iron as a metal,
we could give some information respecting its extraction and manifold uses.
All we need mention here is the fact that iron occurs in nature in various
ores which are essentially composed of iron and oxygen. The iron is
extracted in the blast furnace, in which the process is continued for years.
The “slag,” or glassy scum, protects the molten iron from the air; its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
presence is necessary in all blast furnaces. The most important of the iron
group of minerals are <span class="smcap">Magnetic Iron</span> (magnetite), or
loadstone. This mineral occurs in Sweden and North
America, and is found in primary rocks, and in Scandinavia
forms mountains. It crystallizes in the regular
(octahedron) system, and often in the form in illustration
in the margin. It is highly magnetic, as its name
implies.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_444a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 472.—Magnetic iron.</div>
</div>

<p>Native iron very rarely occurs, and then only in thin
layers. The most extraordinary specimens are those termed meteoric iron,
which fall from the atmosphere in great masses; and the meteoric stones,
which contain ninety per cent of iron, together with other constituents in small
quantities—viz., nickel, cobalt, copper, manganese, carbon, sulphur,
arsenic, etc.</p>

<p><em>Red hematite</em> crystallizes in the hexagonal system. It possesses much
the same (chemical) constitution as corundum
(<em>q. v.</em>). It is brightly metallic, and shows a
red streak. It occurs in various forms, as
iron <em>glance</em> or specular iron, which is found
in Sweden and Russia; micaceous iron, bloodstone,
clay, ironstone, etc.</p>

<p><em>Brown hematite</em> has not been found in
crystals, but brown ironstone (fibrous) is crystalline.
The earthy brown, containing clay,
gives us <em>yellow ochre</em> and <em>umber</em>. <em>Pea-iron
ore</em> and “<em>morass</em>” or “bog” ore also belong
to this class. <em>Limonite</em> is the name given to
these more recent formations, of which yellow
ochre is a pure specimen.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_444b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 473.—Native oxide of iron.</div>
</div>

<p>The combinations of iron with sulphur (pyrites) are also important.
<em>Iron pyrites</em> and <em>magnetic iron pyrites</em> are two which may be mentioned.
The latter first.</p>

<p>Magnetic iron pyrites (or <em>pyrrhotin</em>) crystallizes in six-sided prisms, and
is attracted by the magnet. The composition of this mineral has not been
exactly ascertained, and no chemical formula has been found for it.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Iron Pyrites</span> (bisulphide of iron) is known as <em>cubic pyrites</em>, <em>yellow
pyrites</em>, and <em>mundic</em>. It is generally found in the regular system of crystals,
either as a cube or as a pentagonal dodecahedron. (<i>See</i> first system of crystals,
<em>ante</em>.) Its colour is yellowish. It is known also as <em>green vitriol</em> when
oxidised, and forms beautiful green crystals (copperas). This salt is used
in the preparation of Prussian blue and violet dyes. With gallic acid it
makes ink.</p>

<p>There are many other “ferruginous” minerals, such as <em>vivianite</em>, <em>green
ironstone</em>, white iron pyrites, arsenical pyrites, or mispickel, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span></p>

<p>A carbonate of iron, called <em>chalybite</em>, or spathic ironstone, is very abundant
in nature, and forms obtuse rhombohedrons. It is very useful for the
production of steel, as it forms the clay iron ore found in coal districts in
combination. In a fibrous form it is known as <em>sphærosiderite</em>. It is a most
useful mineral.</p>

<p>Chrome iron (chromite) is useful for the preparation of chromium
compounds. It crystallizes in the cubic system. It is magnetic, especially
when treated. Chromic acid forms scarlet “needle” crystals, and by its
assistance chromate of lead, or <em>chrome yellow</em>, is prepared. (Chromate of lead
is found in a native state as crocoisite). <i>See</i> Chromium.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Manganese</span> is contained in several minerals. It usually occurs as an
oxide. It colours minerals variously. In a pure state manganese is white
and brittle. The chief minerals are—</p>

<p><em>Pyrolusite</em> (the binoxide of manganese of commerce) occurs in crystals. It
is black. It is used in the preparation of chlorine and oxygen. The other
minerals are known as <em>manganite</em>, which is also found associated with pyrolusite,
as are <em>hausmannite</em> and <em>braunite</em>, the other oxides.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Nickel</span> and <span class="smcap">Cobalt</span> are generally found together, both being similar,
and the minerals are compounds of arsenic or sulphur, and occur under
similar circumstances. The principal are of <span class="smcap">Nickel</span> and of <span class="smcap">Cobalt</span>—</p>


<ul class="table"><li>Sulphide of nickel (ullmanite).</li>
<li>Arsenical nickel (nickeline).</li>
<li>Nickel glance (gersdorffite).</li>
<li>Nickel pyrites (siegenite).</li>
<li>Arsenical cobalt (smaltine).</li>
<li>Cobalt glance (cobaltine).</li>
<li>Cobalt bloom (erythrine).</li>
<li>Cobalt pyrites (linnæite).</li>
</ul>


<p>Nickel ores are used for extraction of the metal, which is used as a
substitute for silver. The name is derived from the German, <i lang="de">kupfernickel</i>,
or false copper. It was discovered in 1751.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Copper</span>, again, forms a number of minerals, and the chief is the <em>red
oxide</em> of the metal, called <em>cuprite</em>. It crystallizes in the cubic system. Its
colour is red, and tinges a flame green. <em>Cuprite</em> yields excellent copper,
and is found in Cornwall, and in many places on the continent. The <em>black</em>
oxide is rarely found. It is known as melaconite.</p>

<p><em>Malachite</em> (carbonate of copper) is remarkable for its beautiful green
colour. In Australia it is worked for copper. It is chiefly ornamental.
Siberia yields the finest specimens, but the mineral is found in Cornwall and
Cumberland, as well as on the continent. Chessylite (from Chessy, in France)
is frequently found with malachite. It has been called blue malachite, or
the azure copper ore. It is used as a paint.</p>

<p>Besides the above, copper unites with sulphur to form minerals, such as
the needle ore (bismuthic sulphide of copper), antimonial sulphide, bournonite;
purple copper, and copper pyrites, which is very abundant, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
furnishes us with most of our copper. There is also the “grey” copper ore,
which contains various metals; even silver is obtained from it at times.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bismuth</span> gives us only a few minerals, of secondary importance.
Native bismuth resembles antimony, but is reddish in hue. Bismuth ochre,
bismuth blende, and bismuthine are the chief combinations.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lead</span> is more important, and is obtained from <em>galena</em>, the sulphide of
lead, which is very abundant, and the principal lead ore. It can be at once
distinguished by its high specific gravity and metallic lustre; the “cubic
cleavage” also is very easy. It frequently is found containing silver, and
even gold, antimony, iron, etc. There are several suphantimonites of lead,
such as zinkenite, geocronite, etc., and the salts, such as sulphate of lead and
white lead ore, or carbonate of lead (cerasite). The chromate of lead is
found in the Ural Mountains.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Tin</span> is not found in a native state, but as <em>tinstone</em>, or binoxide of tin,
named <em>cassiterite</em>. It is found largely in Cornwall, and the mines there have
yielded great quantities for generations. Tin pyrites, a union of sulphides
of tin, iron, and copper, is also found in Cornwall.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Zinc</span> is produced from the ore called (zinc) blende, or sulphide of zinc
(black Jack). Its colour is very variable, sometimes red, but when pure is
greenish-yellow. It is also found black and brown. The red oxide of zinc
(or spartalite) is also worked for zinc. The carbonate, or zinc spar, is
common, and used to make brass, as is <em>calamine</em>, which is possessed of a
remarkable lustre, and is even luminous when rubbed. It is a silicious
oxide of zinc, and is found in the sedimentary rocks. When heated, it
displays strong electric properties.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chromium</span> occurs in very few mineral combinations; chromate of lead,
chrome iron, and chrome ochre, or sesqui-oxide of chromium are the only
important ones.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Antimony</span> minerals are very hard; the tersulphide is the most common,
and from this the metallic antimony is produced. Red antimony, the oxide,
is a rarer ore.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Arsenic</span> resembles antimony, and occurs in combination with many
metals. White arsenic, or arsenious acid, is found in Bohemia, Alsace,
Transylvania, etc. Orpiment and realgar are sulphides of arsenic, and are
employed as colouring matters in paint and fireworks. Arsenic is very
poisonous.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mercury</span> is occasionally found native, but more generally as <em>cinnabar</em>.
Chloride of mercury (or calomel) is found associated with the cinnabar, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
hepatic ore. Cinnabar is easily volatilized, and possesses high specific
gravity. The Californian mines are very rich. Spain also produces a large
quantity. It is opaque, and carmine in colour.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Silver</span> occurs native, or in ores. The latter are as follows:—The
sulphide, or the vitreous silver (argentite); antimonial silver; and the combined
sulphides, of antimony and silver. There are many silver minerals,
such as the chloride (horn silver, or kerargyrite), bromide, and carbonate of
silver, bismuthic silver, etc. The bromide and iodide are bromargyrite and
iodargyrite. Silver occurs most frequently associated with gold; natural
alloys of these two metals are found, containing from 0·16 to 38·7 per
cent. of silver, which causes considerable variations both of colour and
density. In addition to this alloy, we may mention <em>sylvanite</em> (graphic tellurium),
which contains, besides gold and silver, one of the rarer metals—viz.,
tellurium.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 474.—Gold crystals.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gold</span> is our most precious mineral, and is generally found native. It
exists in sand and in certain rocks. It crystallizes in various forms, and in
Mexico it is found in companionship with silver and copper sulphides.
Australia and California render the most valuable supplies of the metal.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Platinum</span> is also found native, and rarely is crystals. It is often
alloyed with other metals, chiefly with iron or gold; also with diamonds. We
have already considered it as a metal. Little remains to be said about <em>salts</em> and
<em>resins</em>, for with the exception of those we have referred to under Chemistry,
they are of little value. The bitumens, rock oil, etc., which exude from the
earth, are very useful, and as asphalt and petroleum play an important part
in the civilized world, but scarcely come under the strict rule of minerals
as we consider them, and with this reference we close our sketch of
Mineralogy.</p>

<small>NEW LOCOMOTIVE APPLIANCES.</small></h2>

<p class="hang">THE KITE—THE AEROPHANE—ICE YACHTS—SAILING TRUCKS—WATER
VELOCIPEDES.</p>


<p>The kite, known from the earliest times, and constructed by a number
of people, is a very familiar object, which we shall not describe; for we will
now speak of some similar appliances of a more interesting and uncommon
description.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_448.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 475.—Mr. Penaud’s “High-flier.”</div>
</div>

<p>M. Penaud has invented some appliances in which twisted india-rubber
is the principal agent. Fig. 475 represents a sort of kite, which rises in the
air if one twists and then looses the india-rubber round the central bow.
Fig. 476 represents another kind of invention; it is an “aerophane,” with
a screw at the back, so fixed that it receives no shock from striking against
any obstacle. After having twisted the india-rubber, and loosened our hold
of the apparatus in a horizontal position, it will first descend for an instant,
then, acquiring increased speed, it rises seven or eight feet from the ground,
and describes a regular movement in the air for a distance of about fifty
yards; the motion lasts for several seconds.</p>

<p>Some models have also been constructed capable of traversing a distance
of over seventy yards, remaining for thirteen seconds in the air, as lightly
poised as a bird, and without any connection with the ground. During the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
whole time the rudder restrains with perfect exactitude the ascending and
descending movements as they occur; and we can plainly observe the
various oscillations like those of sparrows, or more especially woodpeckers.
At last, when the movements are coming to an end, the apparatus falls
gently to the ground in a slanting line.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_449.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig 476.—M. Penaud’s “Aerophane.”</div>
</div>

<p>M. Penaud has also succeeded in constructing a mechanical bird, that
we have seen set in motion, which will continue flying for several seconds;
we give an illustration of it in fig. 477.</p>

<p>Another scientist, M. Tatin, has also produced some remarkable
results. His efforts have been unceasingly directed towards the reproduction
of the flight of a bird by means of more or less complicated arrangements.
He has endeavoured to discover in the small appliances made with india<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>rubber,
and used by MM. Penaud and Hureau de Villeneuve, what were the
best shapes in which to reproduce the wings, in order to adapt them to a
large apparatus acting by compressed air. After several attempts, he decided
on the employment of long, narrow wings. Wenham had previously proved
that a wing may be equally effectual whether it be narrow or wide, and
M. Marcy has also declared that birds with a quick, narrow wing-stroke
have always very long wings. By means of these long, narrow wings (fig. 478)
M. Tatin has reduced the time during which the wing reaches a suitable
position for acting on the air when it first descends. Granted the fact, so
long established, that a bird flies more easily if it rests its wing against
a great volume of air, it will be understood that the maximum speed of
movement will also be the most advantageous as regards the reduction of
expended force. The inventor, finding that he could not prevent his mechanical
birds from losing force in proportion as they attained considerable speed,
remedied this defect by <em>placing the centre of gravity in front</em>. In consequence
of this, the bird in full flight preserves the same equilibrium as the bird
hovering in the air, and its speed is, to a certain extent, passive, the mass of
air pressing of its own accord against the wings, all expenditure of force
therefore being utilized for suspension. Thus has M. Tatin been enabled
to increase the weight of his appliances, without increasing the motive power,
and yet obtains a double course.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_450.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 477.—Mechanical bird.</div>
</div>

<p>The movement made by the wing round a longitudinal axis, by means
of which it always exposes its lower surface in front on rising, is obtained
by the mechanism illustrated in fig. 478 <i>a</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">M. Tatin’s Bird.</span></p>

<p>This apparatus, looked at sideways or from behind, is composed of a
light wooden frame, on which are two small supports crossed by an axletree
so as to form two cranks. This axle receives a circular movement from an
india-rubber spring. The crank on the foremost plane causes the rising and
falling of the wings, which move round a common axis, and pass the dead
points as the cranks of a locomotive do—so the action is maintained.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 479.—Back view of apparatus.</div>
</div>

<p>But the wing does not only move as a whole; every part of it,
particularly as it rises, shows a tendency to inclination, which is most
marked towards the extremity; the part near the body alone preserves
an invariable obliquity. M. Tatin was of opinion that it is with the
screw that it is necessary to direct the twisting movement; and to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
it with all its transitions, he has substituted for silk wings, which fold
up, some wings composed entirely of strong feathers, arranged in such a
manner that they slipped one over the other when in motion. The arrangement
was perfect, but still not suitable
for adaptation to the large bird.
The inventor therefore again returned
to the use of the silk wings, which he
appears to have definitely adopted.
By means of certain modifications
which he has recently introduced in
his larger apparatus—viz., a change
in the shape of the wings, variation
of the amplitude in the flapping, etc.,
M. Tatin has been enabled to make
great progress. The bird, acting by
means of compressed air, at first
could only raise three-quarters of its
own weight, but finally lifted itself
entirely. And we must take into
consideration that the apparatus has
to struggle against the weight of
the steering apparatus, which nullifying the vertical and horizontal reactions
of the bird during flight, constantly fulfils the office of regulator.</p>

<p>We will now pass to the consideration of two ingenious appliances
of a very clever inventor, M. Salleron.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Small Atmospheric Boat.</span></p>

<p>The little boat shown in fig. 480, which is about the size of an ordinary
plaything, is a very ingenious, if not a practical, application of the specific
lightness of air acting as a propelling force. In this instance steam plays
but a secondary part, which consists in carrying off the air that causes the
moving of the boat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_452b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 480.—Atmospheric boat.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span></p>

<p>The apparatus, as represented in fig. 481, is of extreme simplicity, as
will be seen at a glance. A small cylindrical boiler, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, connected with a
capillary tube, is placed on two supports over a spirit-lamp, in such a manner
that the opening from which the steam issues is directly opposite the mouth
of the tube, <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>. This tube, after forming a sudden inclination, terminates at
the back of the boat in an inclined drain, <span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. The steam driven through the
tube, <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>, carries along with it a certain quantity of air, which, forced under
the water, propels the boat along. The little vessel soon reaches considerable
speed, leaving a long track behind it. It will be seen that this is not a
mechanical apparatus, capable of absorbing force or diminishing the action of
steam by causing its condensation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_453.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 481.—Section of “atmospheric” boat.</div>
</div>

<p>Let us now calculate the force engendered by this apparatus. We
know that a litre of water at boiling point gives 1,700 times its volume.
The steam, as it quickly issues from the opening of the boiler, carries along
at least ten times its volume, or 17,000 litres of air, which, driven under the
water, assumes an ascending force equal to the difference of the densities of
water and air, or about the weight of the displaced water. Therefore in a
litre of water transformed into 1,700 litres of the steam, which carries off
into the water 1,700 × 10 = 17,000 litres of air, a force is developed represented
by 34,000 kilograms. In fact, by reason of the inclined position of
the drain on which the pressure of air acts, and its restricted dimensions, the
quantity of force employed in the propulsion of the boat is but a fraction of
the total force produced. Moreover, the resistance of traction increases with
the size of the boat, and as the dimensions of the inclined pipe cannot be
indefinitely enlarged, the result is that the propulsive action is soon insufficient,
so that the invention is not, in its present condition, applicable to
navigation on a large scale. Its superiority to the steam-engine cannot,
therefore, be demonstrated; and we are only now discussing the contrivance
in order to show that it is possible, with only moderately powerful generators
and extremely simple mechanical appliances, to obtain considerable
dynamic effects, susceptible of more serviceable application than is commonly
believed.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Circulating Fountain.</span></p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_454.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 482.—Circulating fountain.</div>
</div>

<p>The apparatus given in fig. 482 is the subject of a very charming experiment,
showing the influence of capillarity on the movements of liquids.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
Two glass balls, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">B´</span>, are connected by two tubes; one straight and of rather
large diameter, the other extremely slender, and winding in and out in a
more or less complicated manner. The large tube passes
into ball <span class="smcap lowercase">B´</span>, and forms a slender point, <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span>, at the orifice of
the narrow tube. At the lower end of the ball is a
bulb, which is closed with a cork, and contains a
coloured liquid. The apparatus is fixed to a board with
a ring at each end, by which it can be hung on the wall.
When commencing the experiment, it should be hung so
that the ball <span class="smcap lowercase">B´</span> is uppermost. The liquid then flows through
into the ball <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, without presenting any particular phenomenon.
The apparatus is then turned, and the liquid descends
again with great speed, shoots through the opening, <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span>, and
rises into the twisted tube. The air displaced from ball
<span class="smcap lowercase">B´</span> also rises, however, and mingles with the liquid, and it
can be seen circulating through the winding tube in a number
of air-bubbles, mingled with drops of liquid, gradually
transmitting the pressure of the column contained in the
upper ball and straight tube; so that by means of a similar
phenomenon to that of the fountain of Nero, the liquid rises
higher than the level of the reservoir, a part falling into
ball <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, which causes the experiment to be a little prolonged.
This circulation of air-bubbles and coloured drops through
the twisted tube of the apparatus has a very pretty effect.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Pneumatic Pencil.</span></p>

<p>This ingenious invention is productive of results
similar to Edison’s electric pen. It is the invention of
an American gentleman, Mr. J. W. Brickenridge, of
Lafayette, Indiana. The illustration (fig. 483) explains the mechanism of
the pneumatic pencil. The whole apparatus is figured on the left side
of the picture, while the longitudinal section of the pencil is shown
on the right, the small cut at the top being a vertical section of a portion
of the motive power. Compressed air furnishes the power of pressure,
which is accomplished by means of a perforating needle.</p>

<p>If the treadle is put in motion, a backward and forward movement is
imparted to a flexible diaphragm, as in the upper section in the centre of the
illustration. By this movement the air is permitted to enter, and is compressed
by the diaphragm into the flexible tube with which the diaphragm
is connected. The air is thus brought into contact with another diaphragm
at the end of the tube and presses on it. The pencil is fixed to the latter.
When it is desired to use the pencil the apparatus is set in motion, and by
a series of sharp, quick perforations, any writing can be traced, as by the
electric pen. This indentation can be copied over and over again in a press,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
the writing acting as the negative; and if ink be first run over it, as in
a stencil plate, by a proper “roller,” the latter will come out as plainly as
possible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 483.—Pneumatic pencil.</div>
</div>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tube Wells.</span></p>

<p>The principle upon which the tube well depends is very simple. It is
well known that in certain localities water lies a short distance beneath the
surface of the ground, and a very little trouble would satisfy us upon the
point, and render us quite independent of the water companies’ supply. On
the supposition that the water exists underneath our garden at, say, twenty-five
feet beneath the surface of the ground, we have only to drive into the
soil a tube for that distance, and by the assistance of a common pump we
shall obtain a pure supply of water.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to describe the manner in which these wells are
sunk. The first step is to fix a platform firmly upon the ground and bore a
hole, by which the tube is to enter the ground. This tube should be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
thick, with an aperture of two inches or rather less, and three or four yards
in length. The lower portion should be pierced with holes, as in the illustration,
and terminating in a point of extremely fine-tempered steel. This
tube can be driven into the ground by mallets, or by the suspended hammer,
worked as shown in the illustration (fig. 484). This work will be easily
accomplished, and when the first length of tube has been driven in, another
can be fixed to it and hammered down in the same way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_456.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 484.—Tube Well.</div>
</div>

<p>When the tubes have been driven to the depth indicated it will be as
well to let down a sounding line, a simple cord sustaining a pebble. If the
stone be pulled up dry, another length of tube can be added, or the tubes can
be pulled up, and another trial made. If, on the contrary, the pebble come
up wet, the object is accomplished, and a small pump can be fixed to the
upper end of the tube, as in fig. 485. At first the water will be found a little
thick and muddy, in consequence of the disturbance of the soil and the particles
adhering to the end of the first tube; but after an hour or so it will be
found that the water has become quite clear. It need scarcely be said that
if the water possesses sufficient ascensional force to rise to the level of the
ground a pump need not be employed. An Artesian Well will, in that
case, be the result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_457.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 485.—Abyssinian Pump.</div>
</div>

<p>The operation described on page 456 can usually be performed without
any difficulty. Sometimes, however, the tube may come in contact with a
large stone, and in that case the experiment must be tried elsewhere; but, as
a rule, the pointed tube, in consequence of its small size and penetrative power,
pushes any moderately-sized obstacle
aside, readily turns aside
itself, or passes between pieces
of stone to the desired depth.
Nine times out of ten the
operation will be successful, and
the experiment will not occupy
more than an hour, under ordinary
circumstances, and the
tubing (and pump) may be
obtained at a moderate price,
which can even be diminished
by arrangement. Ordinary
wells are relatively very difficult
to sink, and the soil thrown
out from the pit is in the way,
while a parapet is necessary to
protect the opening. Besides,
should water not be found after
much work, the expense and
trouble of digging will be uselessly
incurred. Thanks to the
tube system, we can search or
probe for water anywhere with
ease, and if we do not find it
in one spot we can easily move
on to another without incurring
any serious trouble or expense.</p>

<p>We believe the idea of
these “instantaneous wells”
originated in the United States
during the War of Secession,
when some soldiers of the
Northern army sunk rifle barrels
into the ground, and obtained
water in a barren land. To
Mr. Norton the development of
the idea is due, and in the Abyssinian Expedition the utility of the
notion was fully demonstrated. Since that time M. Donnet of Lyons
has modified and improved the tube-well, and arranged all the materials,
including wider tubing and the hammers upon a carriage, thus giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
greater facilities to the workmen and to those desirous of sinking such
wells.</p>

<p>The general arrangement of M. Donnet, and the carriage with its equipments
utilized, is depicted in fig. 484; the actual sinking of the well is
carried out just as originally performed by Mr. Norton.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 486.—Swimming apparatus.</div>
</div>

<p>We have to mention a novel means of swimming, which may prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
useful to those who distrust the natural buoyancy of water and their own
powers of keeping afloat or swimming. The simple apparatus, shown in
fig. 486, is the invention of an American named Richardson, a citizen of
Mobile, U.S.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 487.—Nautical Velocipede.</div>
</div>

<p>The machine consists, essentially, of a shaft, upon which a float is fixed,
and at the end of the shaft is a small screw propeller. The shaft is put in
motion by a wheel arrangement worked by the hands, and by a crank moved
by the feet. The swimmer rests upon the float, with his head well above
water. The float sustains him, while the propeller forces him through the
water, without his feeling fatigued, at the rate of about five miles an hour. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
certain amount of practice is necessary to obtain complete command of the
machine, but when mastered the swimmer can proceed, without much exertion,
at a rapid rate. The apparatus itself is not difficult to make, and persons
who have tried it speak highly of its convenience and of the facilities it may
afford. Captain Boyton’s swimming-dress is another useful invention, but
the means of mechanical propulsion are wanting, while in this new apparatus
the swimmer can drive himself through the sea with ease and expedition, and
even a non-swimmer may thereby save life without danger to himself, or the
person he wishes to rescue.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Nautical Velocipede</span>, which also deserves some notice at our
hands, is the invention of M. Croce-Spinelli, who tried it upon the great
lake of Vincennes and also on the Seine, when it was the object of much
curiosity; but when the Franco-German war broke out the experiments were
discontinued, and the inventor did not live to perfect the apparatus. He fell
a victim to his love for ballooning. But M. Joberts, a practical machinist,
has lately taken up the idea broached by Croce-Spinelli, and has brought
out a new water velocipede of very ingenious construction, with satisfactory
results. The machine is described as follows. There are two hollow tin
“floats” of cylindrical form, and tapered at the ends. These floats are
joined together by a platform made of very light wood, on which the seat of
the worker is raised, and underneath is the machinery for propelling the velocipede.
The motive power is very simple, and corresponds to that employed
to propel the bicycle on land, by the feet of the rider, the wheel being
furnished with paddles in the water velocipede.</p>

<p>A rudder, which can easily be worked by cords, gives the velocipedist
complete control of the machine, the steering being performed by a handle
similar to that which the bicyclist uses to turn the machine he rides. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
fact, the “water” velocipede is an adaptation of the “terrestrial” machine so
familiar to all readers. This velocipede is equally adapted for sea or lake
progression, the waves of the former being, under ordinary circumstances, no
obstruction, for very little motion is imparted to the sitter. For those desirous
to bathe in deep water the machine offers many facilities; and in the case of
attack of cramp or faintness, rescue would not be difficult, as the swimmer
could support himself upon the pointed cylinders of the water velocipede till
assistance arrived. On the other hand, it is very necessary to know how to
swim before attempting to work the machine.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 490.—Ice boats.</div>
</div>

<p>Before describing the ice-yachts which are used in Canada when winter’s
cold grasp lies on water and land, we will mention a very curious experiment
in water locomotion made a year or two ago. The illustration
explains itself. It is not an imaginary sketch, it is the record of fact.</p>

<p>This sagacious seal was exhibited in London, and was in the habit of
performing certain tricks, one item of his performance being to draw the light
canoe (as represented), and another accomplishment consisted in “striking
the light guitar,” to the astonishment of the spectators, amongst whom was
the writer. The instrument was placed between his fins, or “flappers,” and
the seal twanged it more or less melodiously. He was very tame, and
obedient to his master and trainer.</p>

<p>We all have heard of, even if we have not seen, the twin steamer
<em>Castalia</em>, which, pending the opening of the tunnel beneath the Channel, was
supposed to reduce sea-sickness to a minimum. The <em>Castalia</em> did not answer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
however, but an American has planned certain double yachts, of which we
give an illustration. The sailing-boats, as represented, have had much success
upon the lake of Cayuga, and are quite seaworthy,—in fact, it is impossible
to overturn them.</p>

<p>The weight of one of these yachts is about fifteen hundred pounds, and
the draught six inches. Having two keels they answer the helm very readily.
The boat, in the centre of the illustration, belongs to Mr. Prentiss, and is called
the <em>Pera Ladronia</em>. It is a very fast “ship.”</p>

<p>From navigation in water, we now come to navigation <em>on</em> water. The
ice-boats are much used in Canada, and their simple but effective construction
will be readily perceived from the accompanying illustration. The
Americans state that these ice-yachts can run before a good breeze as fast as
an ordinary train. There are, or were, models of some such (Finland) yachts
in the South Kensington Museum with two sails. The American yacht, as
a rule, has only one sail, and the owners say—but we will not vouch for the
truth of the allegation—that they frequently run far ahead of the wind that
primarily propelled them!</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sailing on Land.</span></p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_463.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 491.—Sailing carriage of the 17th century, from a drawing of the period.</div>
</div>

<p>It is quite possible to sail upon
land, although this statement may appear
contradictory in terms. “The force of
the wind upon sails,” says Bishop Wilkins
in his work, “Mathematical Magic,”
printed in London in 1648, “can be
applied to vehicles on land as well as to
ships at sea. Such conveyances,” he adds,
“have long been in use in China and in
Spain, as well as in flat countries, such as
Holland, where they have been employed
with great success. In the last-named
country they are propelled with greater
speed than are ships before a fair wind;
so that in a few hours a boat containing
several persons actually travelled
nearly two hundred miles, with no
trouble to any one on board except
the steersman, who had little difficulty in
guiding the boat.”</p>

<p>The astonishment expressed by the good bishop was quite justified, for,
as a matter of fact, a carriage or boat on wheels, with sails, as shown in the
illustration, achieved a distance of nearly thirty-eight miles in an hour. This
pace was quite unknown at that time; such a rate of travelling had never
entered the minds of people then. “Men running in front of the machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
after a while appeared to be going backwards, so quickly were they
overtaken and passed.” “Objects at a distance were approached in the
twinkling of an eye, and were left far in the rear.” So it is evident that, had
locomotion by steam not been adopted, the mode of sailing on land would
have eventually become the most rapid mode of transit, and it is rather
remarkable that it was never adopted as a mode of travel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_464.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 492.—On the Kansas Pacific Railway.</div>
</div>

<p>But Bishop Wilkins had not to reproach himself on this account, for
he adapted the principle of the windmill to carriages, “so that the sails would
turn and move his car, no matter in what direction the wind was blowing.”
He proposed to make these sails act upon the wheels of a carriage, and
trusted to “make it move in any direction, either with the wind or against
it!” This suggestion has been lately adopted in the United States, and it
is curious that after two hundred and fifty years no better mode for utilizing
wind-power on land has ever been found. Perhaps the ice-boats already
mentioned may be the forerunners of some new system of “land transport,”
for which enormous kites have been made available.</p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that if the introduction of railroads quite
“took the wind out of the sails” of any other mode of locomotion on <i lang="la">terra
firma</i>, it is that very iron track which has led to the reintroduction of sails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
as a mode of progression upon the rails. In the United States at the present
time there are many vehicles propelled by sails across the immense prairies
at a pace, with a strong wind, which equals that of the trains. We are
indebted to Mr. Wood, of Hayes City, Kansas, for the photograph from which
the picture of the sailing-waggon, invented by Mr. Bascom, of the Kansas
Pacific Railway, is copied. This carriage travels usually at thirty miles an
hour, and a speed of forty miles an hour has been obtained when the wind
has been high and blowing directly “aft.” The distance of eighty-four miles
has been accomplished in four hours when the wind was “on the beam,” or a
little forward of it, and on some curves with an almost contrary breeze.</p>

<p>The newest machine has four wheels, each thirty inches in diameter; it
is six feet in length, and weighs six hundred pounds. The sails are carried
upon two masts, and they contain about eighty-one square feet of canvas.
The main, or principal mast, is eleven feet high, four inches in diameter at
the base, and two inches at the top. As in the case of the ice-boats, it is
claimed for the sailing carriage that it frequently outstrips the wind that
propels it along the track. On the other hand, there is a difference between
the best sailing points of the two kinds of vehicle. The ice-boat goes
quickest with the wind “dead aft,” the carriage makes best time with the
wind “on the beam”—<i>i.e.</i>, sideways. The greater friction and larger surface
exposed to the influence of a side-wind no doubt will account for the difference
between the speed of the railway sailing-carriage and the ice-boat.</p>

<p>Mr. Bascom informs us that the carriage we have described is in frequent
use upon the Kansas Pacific Railway, where it is employed to transport
materials for the necessary repairs of the line, telegraph, etc., etc. It is a
very cheap contrivance, and a great economizer of labour. We all have
noticed the cumbrous method of “trolly-kicking” by “navvies” along the
line. A trolly fitted with a sail would, in many cases, and on many English
lines, save a great deal of trouble, time, and exertion to the plate-layers.</p>

<p>Astronomy is the science which treats of the heavenly bodies and the laws
which govern them. The term is derived from two Greek words, <i lang="el">astron</i>, a
star, and <i lang="el">nomos</i>, a law. It may be included in the study of Physics, for the
motion of the planetary bodies and equilibrium, gravity, etc., all have something
to say to the arrangements and positions of the stars. The space in
which they are set is infinite, and known as the “Firmament,” or “Heaven.”
The number of the heavenly bodies must therefore be infinite also. We
can see a few stars, comparatively speaking, and there must be numbers
whose light has never yet reached the earth. When we calmly reason upon
the immeasurable distances and the awful rapidity of motion, with the
masses of matter thus in movement, we are constrained to acknowledge that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
all our boasted knowledge is as nothing in the wondrous dispensations of
Him “who telleth the number of the stars, and calleth them all by their
names.”</p>

<p>Astronomy, no more than any other of the physical sciences, cannot
stand by itself. We have seen how heat, light, electricity, etc., are all, in
a manner, inter-dependent. So astronomy is dependent upon mathematics,
particularly geometry and trigonometry, for the wondrous problems to be
solved. But in the following sketch we do not propose to plunge the
reader in the slough of calculations. We only desire to put plainly before
him the great phenomena of nature with regard to the heavens, and the
glorious orbs which so thickly stud the space above us. We need not
detail the laborious calculations by which philosophers have arrived at
certain discoveries. We may refer to the results and explain general
principles, thereby indicating the road by which the student may arrive at
the more difficult bypaths in the fields of scientific discovery.</p>

<p>The history of astronomy is nearly as old as the world itself, or rather
as old as the human race. From the earliest ages we can picture men
gazing upon the “spangled heavens,” and the wandering tribes of the desert
were always very careful observers of the paths of the stars. To the nomads
of the East the planetary system served as compass and clock, calendar and
barometer.</p>

<p>We shall find, therefore, that many observations of the heavenly bodies
were made by the ancients, and have descended to more advanced generations,
and this leads us to remark that the science of astronomy can be
studied without any very special or costly apparatus. In other branches of
science numerous instruments are indispensable before we can reveal to ourselves
the desired results. In astronomy, a telescope—even a good field
glass, such as possessed by any household, will reveal many interesting facts.
We will, by means of more expensive instruments, and by the aid of large
telescopes particularly, enjoy the sight of the moon and planets. But even
with the naked eye a great variety of phenomena may be observed. With a
celestial globe in our hands upon a fine starry night, we can easily find out
the position of the constellations, and trace their forms in the firmament.</p>

<p>It is to the Chaldeans, Indians, Chinese, and Egyptians, that our knowledge
of astronomy is primarily due. They did much to facilitate the
observation of the stars; they named the planets, grouped the stars, and
marked the sun’s track in the sky. <em>Astrology</em> was cultivated in very remote
ages. The Jews practised it; and the astrologers of subsequent periods
played very important parts in divining the future of individuals, and casting
their <em>horoscopes</em>. Many of these so-called predictions came true, “because,”
as was remarked by Pascal, “as misfortunes are common they” (the astrologers)
“are often right,” as they foretold misfortune oftener than good fortune. Still
the fact remains that occasionally a very startling prediction was made, and
proved true; such, for instance, as the laying waste of Germany by Gustavus
Adolphus, which was foretold by Tycho Brahé after his consideration of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
certain comet, and the date of the king’s death was also correctly prophesied.
Astrology, therefore, held a very considerable influence over the human race
during the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>We can only give a very brief historical summary of the science. We
know that the destinies of individuals and nations were at a very early period
attributed to the influence of the stars. We read that “the stars in their
courses fought against Sisera,” and many expressions surviving to the present
time serve to remind us that the stars were at one time paramount in men’s
minds. Thus we have the phrases—“unlucky star,” “born under a lucky
star,” “mark my stars,” “moonstruck,” etc. Even the common term “consider”—to
take counsel of the stars—is thus accounted for, and many men have a
habit of looking up to the ceiling of a room or to the sky when thinking
deeply—considering with the stars. “Contemplate” is another term signifying
the same thing; for <i lang="la">templum</i>, a temple, was formerly a space marked upon
the sky in imaginary lines, and traced on the ground in accordance with the
supposed diagram. Thus temple became a place for heavenly “contemplation,”
and by an easy transition to a place of worship. In our old poets’
writings we have many allusions to the influences of the stars.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Although from Thales, who lived <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 610, the real science of astronomy
may be allowed to date, there can be no doubt that the ancients were
acquainted with many phenomena. The Chaldeans were, doubtless, the first
to place on record the rising and setting of the celestial bodies and eclipses,
and used the water-clock (clepsydra). A list of eclipses from 2234 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
is stated to have been found at Babylon by Alexander the Great. The
Chaldeans also divided the ecliptic into twelve equal parts, and the day and
night into twenty-four hours. The Chinese, again, have recorded astronomical
phenomena as far back as 2857 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>; and the Egyptians also were
well versed in the science, although no records of much importance remain
to us, unless the zodiac signs were their invention.</p>

<p>Thales predicted the eclipse of the sun <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 610. Aristarchus and Eratosthenes
also made important observations. Hipparchus (160-125 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>)
discovered the precession of the equinoxes, calculated eclipses, determined
the length of the year, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Ptolemy, of Alexandria, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 130-150, was the founder of a theory
called the Ptolemaic System, which recognized the earth as the centre of all—the
sun, moon, stars, etc., all revolving in very complicated courses around
it, as figured in the diagram herewith. Even though his theory turned
out to be untenable, he paved the way for his successors in other ways, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
left a valuable collection of observations on record. In this volume, called
the “Almagest,” he reviewed the
state of the science, and gave a
catalogue of stars, as well as a
description of the heavens. He
discovered the lunar evection.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_469.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> Fig. 494.—Ptolemaic System.</div>
</div>

<p>After his time astronomy,
though it was not neglected, appeared
to droop, and it is at a
comparatively late period that we
again open the records—viz., in
1543, the year in which Copernicus
died. This philosopher,
who was born in 1473, promulgated
the true theory of the solar
system. He placed the sun in
the centre of the planets, and by
this he explained their motion
around the sun, though they appeared to be carried round the earth. The
book in which he explained his theory, “De Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium,”
was not finished till a day or two before he died.</p>

<p>The justly celebrated Tycho Brahé was the most important of the
successors of Copernicus, but he opposed the Copernican theory, while other
able philosophers agreed with it. Brahé was a Dane; he died in 1601.
He adopted the theory that the sun and moon revolved around the earth,
while the (other) planets moved around the sun. This theory did not gain
much credence, but he, again, though he could not defeat Copernicus, and
though he was wrong in his assumption, made many important investigations.
After him came Kepler, whose observations upon the planet Mars
cleared away many complications, and he laid down three laws, which are as
follows:—</p>

<p>1. Every planet describes an elliptic orbit about the sun, which
occupies one focus of each such ellipse.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_469b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 495.—Copernican System.</div>
</div>

<p>2. If a line be drawn from the sun, continually,
to any planet, this line will sweep over
equal areas in equal times.</p>

<p>3. The squares of the periodic times of the
planets are proportional to the cubes of their mean
distances from the sun.</p>

<p>Kepler also remarked that gravity was a
power existing between all bodies, and reasoned
upon the tides being caused by the attraction of
the moon for the waters.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 497.—Radii Vectores.</div>
</div>

<p>It was about this time—viz., the beginning of
the seventeenth century—that the telescope was invented, and logarithms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
came into use. The actual discoverer of this now almost perfected instrument
is uncertain. Borelli, who
wrote in the seventeenth century,
ascribes the discovery to Zachariah
Jansen and Hans Lippersheim,
spectacle makers of Middleburg.
Baptista Porta, also a
spectacle maker, has had the
credit of discovering the magnifying power of the
lens, and, so far, the originator of the telescope.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_470c.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 498.—Ecliptic and Equator.</div>
</div>

<p>But whoever invented it, the telescope did not penetrate into southern
Europe till 1608-9. Galileo then made inquiries concerning the new instrument,
and Kepler made some propositions for their construction. But
Harriot had used the instrument so far back as 1611 or 1612, and had
observed spots upon the sun’s disc. Galileo, in 1610, had also made observations
with the telescope, and discovered the satellites of Jupiter. He
thereby confirmed the Copernican theory;<a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> and when Newton promulgated
his immortal discovery of gravitation, after Picard’s researches, the relations
of the sun and planets became more evident. His researches were published
in the <cite>Principia</cite>, and then one-half the scientific world began to question the
principle of gravitation, which was supported by Newton and his adherents.
Subsequently the researches of Lagrange and Laplace, Adams and Leverrier,
Sir J. Herschel, etc., brought astronomy into prominence more and more;
and the innumerable stars have been indicated as new planets have been
discovered. The spectroscope, which gives us the analyses of the sun and
other heavenly bodies, has, in the able hands of living astronomers, revealed
to us elements existing in the vapours and composition of the sun, etc.
Stars are now known to be suns, some bearing a great resemblance to our
sun, others differing materially. The
nebulæ have been analysed, and found to
be stars, or gas, burning in space—hydrogen
and nitrogen being the chief constituents
of this glowing matter. Instruments
for astronomical observation have
now been brought to a pitch of perfection
scarcely ever dreamed of, and month
by month discoveries are made and recorded,
while calculations as to certain
combinations can be made with almost
miraculous accuracy. The transit of
Venus, the approaches of comets, eclipses,
and the movements of stars, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
now known accurately, and commented upon long before the event can
take place.</p>

<p>We will close this chapter
by giving a brief explanation
of the various definitions
most usually employed
in astronomy.</p>

<p>1. The <em>Axis</em> of the earth
is an <em>imaginary</em> line passing
through the centre (north and
south); the <em>poles</em> are the extremities
of this line.</p>

<p>2. The <em>Equator</em> is an
imaginary circle passing round
the globe, dividing it into
northern and southern hemispheres.
The <em>equinoctial</em> is
the plane of the former circle
extended to the heavens, and
when the sun appears in that
line the days and nights are
of equal duration—twelve hours each.</p>

<p>3. The <em>Ecliptic</em> is the sun’s path through the heavens—though, of
course, the sun does not actually move, and therefore the track, or supposed
circle, is really the earth’s motion observable from the sun. When the moon
is near this circle eclipses happen. The ecliptic cuts the equinoctial at an
angle of about 23°. One half is to the north and the other to the south of
the equinoctial.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_471.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 499.—The Zodiac.</div>
</div>

<p>4. The <em>Zodiac</em> is a girdle extending 8° on each side of the ecliptic, in
which space of 16° the planets move. The zodiac is divided into twelve
parts of 30° each, called the “Signs.” These names are as under written:—</p>

</table></div>

<p>5. <em>Colures</em> are two circles dividing the ecliptic into four equal parts, and
making the seasons.</p>

<p>6. The <em>Horizon</em> is the boundary line of our vision, and is called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
sensible (apparent) horizon. The true horizon is the circle—as on a globe—dividing
the heavens into two hemispheres.
The sensible horizon is enlarged
according as the eye is elevated
above the ground. A man six feet
high can see a distance of three miles
when standing on a plain. We can
always find the distance visible when
we know the height at which we stand,
or, inversely, we can tell the height of
an object if we know the distance. We
have only to increase the height <em>one
half in feet</em>, and extract the square
root for the distance in miles. On
giving the distance in miles reverse the
operation.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_472a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 500.—Right ascension.</div>
</div>

<p>For instance, for the man six feet high, as supposed, add three feet,
being half his height; that makes nine feet. The square root (or number
multiplied by itself to give nine) is three, which is the number of miles the
man can see on a plain. Or, again, suppose we can see a tower on the
level, and we know we are twelve miles away from it. The square of twelve
is one hundred and forty-four feet, one-third of that is forty-eight feet, which
represents the half of the original height added to the whole tower in feet;
so the whole tower is ninety-six feet high. Reversing, as in the former case,
we can prove this by taking the tower at ninety-six feet high and trying to
find the distance we can see from its summit = 96 + 48 = 144; the square
root of 144 = 12, the distance required.</p>

<p>7. The <em>Nadir</em> and the <em>Zenith</em> are the poles of the horizon. The zenith is
exactly overhead, the nadir exactly
under foot. Circles drawn through
these points are azimuth circles.</p>

<p>8. <em>Meridians</em> are circles passing
through the poles at right angles to
the equinoctial. Every place is supposed
to have a meridian, but only
twenty-four are upon the globe, and
they represent the sun’s, or the planets’,
“movements” every hour—15° being
one hour, 360° being twenty-four hours
(<i>see</i> fig. 500). One quarter of a degree
equals one minute of time. Parallels
of latitude are familiar circles parallel
to the equator. Latitude in astronomy
is the distance from the ecliptic at a
right angle north or south. This will be explained as we proceed.</p>

<p>11. The <em>Orbit</em> is the path described by a planet revolving round the
sun. The plane of the orbit is an imaginary surface cutting through the
centre of the sun and the planet, and extending to the stars. The diagram
shows the plane of the earth’s orbit. The circle, <span class="smcap lowercase">A B C D</span> (fig. 501), is the
ecliptic. The inclination of an orbit is the plane of the orbit with reference
to the plane of the earth; and, supposing the shaded part of the illustration
to be water, a hoop held <em>inclined towards the earth</em>, with one half in and the
other half out of the water, will describe the planetary orbit.</p>

<small>ANGLES AND MEASUREMENT OF ANGLES.</small></h2>

<p class="hang">THE QUADRANT—TRANSIT INSTRUMENT—CLOCKS—STELLAR TIME—SOLAR
TIME—“MEAN” TIME.</p>


<p>We must say a few words respecting the various instruments and aids
to astronomical observation before proceeding, for astronomy requires very
accurate calculations; and though we do not propose to be very scientific in
our descriptions, some little idea of the manner in which observations may
be made is necessary. The first thing to see about is the
<span class="smcap">Angle</span>.</p>

<p>Suppose we draw four lines on a piece of paper, <i>ab</i>
and <i>cd</i>. These intersect at a point, <i>m</i>. We have then four
spaces marked out, and called <em>angles</em>. The four angles are
in the diagram all the same size, and are termed <em>right
angles</em>, and the lines containing them are perpendicular to
each other.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_474a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 503.—Right angles.</div>
</div>

<p>But by altering the position of the lines (<i>see</i> fig. 504), we have two
pairs of angles quite different from right angles; one angle, <i>a´ m´ c´</i>, is smaller,
while <i>a´ m´ d´</i> is much larger than the right angle.
The former kind are called <i>acute</i>, the latter <i>obtuse</i>
angles. We can therefore obtain a great number of
acute angles, but only three obtuse, and four right
angles around a given point, <i>m</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_474b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 504.—Obtuse and acute angles.</div>
</div>

<p>The length of the sides of an angle have no effect on its magnitude,
which is determined by the inclination of the lines towards each other. We
now may consider the magnitude of angles, and the way to determine them.
For this purpose we must describe a circle, which is
figured in the diagram. But what is a circle?—A
circle is a curved line which always is at the same
distance from a certain fixed point, and the ends
of this line meet at the point from which the line
started.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_474c.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 505.—The circle, etc.</div>
</div>

<p>If we fasten a nail or hold a pencil on the
table, and tie a thread to it, and to the other end
of the thread another pencil, we can describe a line
around the first pencil by keeping the thread tightly
stretched. This line is at all points at equal distance from the centre point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
Any line from the centre to the circumference is called a <em>radius</em>, and a line
through the centre to each side of the circumference is the diameter, or double
the radius. The circumference is three (3·14) times the diameter. Any
portion, say <i>k i l</i>, is an <em>arc</em>, and the line, <i>k l</i>, is the <i>chord</i> of that arc. A line
like <i>m n</i> is a <em>secant</em>, and <i>o p</i> is a <em>tangent</em>, or a line touching at one point only.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_475a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 506.—Circle and angles.</div>
</div>

<p>We may now resume our consideration of the angles by means of the
circle. Let us recur to our previous figure of the
right angles, around which we will describe a circle.
We see that the portion of the circumference contained
between the sides of the right angle is
exactly one-fourth of the whole. This is termed a
<em>quadrant</em>, and is divided into 90°—the fourth of
360 equal parts or degrees into which the whole
circumference is divided. The angle of 45° so
often quoted as an angle of inclination is half a
right angle. To measure angles an instrument
called a <em>Protractor</em> is used.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_475b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 507.—The Protractor.</div>
</div>

<p>The Protractor, as will be seen from the accompanying illustration (fig.
507), is a semi-circle containing 180°. The lower portion is a <em>diagonal
scale</em>, the use of which will be explained presently. The Protractor measures
any actual angle with accuracy. If we put the vertical point of the angle
and the centre point of the circle together, we can arrive at the dimensions
of the angle by producing the lines containing it to the circumference. An
angle instrument, figured herewith, may be assumed as the basis of most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
apparatus for measuring angles. An index hand, <span class="smcap lowercase">R R</span>, moves round a dial
like the hand of a clock, and the instrument
is used by gazing first at one of
the two objects, between which the
angle we wish to determine is made—like
the church steeples (fig. 508) for
instance. The centre of the instrument
is placed upon the spot where lines, if
drawn from the eye to each of the objects, would intersect. The index
hand is then put at 0°, and in a
line between the observer and the
object, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>. Then the index is
moved into a similar position towards
<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, and when in line with it
the numbers of degrees passed
over (in this imaginary case 20),
shows the magnitude of the angle.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 509.—Measuring angles.</div>
</div>

<p>The simple quadrant is
shown in the cut (fig. 510). This
was so arranged that when any object in the horizon was being looked at
through the telescope attached, a plummet line is at 0°. But if the
telescope be raised to <span class="smcap lowercase">C S</span>, the quadrant will
move, and the line will mark a certain
number of degrees of the angle which a line
if drawn from the star makes with the line
of the horizon. The “Astronomical Quadrants”
are as shown in fig. 516, and consist
of a quadrant of wood strengthened and
fitted with a telescope. The circle is
graduated on the outer edge, and a “vernier”
is attached. The time is determined by the
observation of the altitude of a star, and then
by calculation finding out at what time the
star would have the observed altitude. The
quadrant is now superseded by circular instruments.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 511.—Ellipse.</div>
</div>

<p>An ellipse is a flattened circle, or oval,
and will be understood from the diagrams.
Let us fix two pegs upon a sheet of paper, and take
a thread longer than the distance between the pegs;
draw with the pencil controlled by the thread a figure,
keeping the thread tight. We shall thus describe an
oval, or ellipse. The orbit of nearly all the heavenly
bodies is an ellipse. The <em>parabola</em> is another curved
line, but its ends never meet; they become more and more distant as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
are continued. The comets move in parabolic curves, and consequently do
not again come within our vision unless their direction be altered.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 513.—Diagonal scale.</div>
</div>

<p>This figure has a long axis, <i>ab</i> (fig. 512); and perpendicular to this a
short axis, <i>de</i>, passing through the centre, <i>c</i>. The two
points, <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span>, are called the <i>foci</i> of the
ellipse; also, as is evident from
the construction of the figure, any
two lines drawn from the two foci,
to any point of the circumference,
for instance, <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span><i>m</i>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span><i>m′</i>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span><i>m′</i>, etc., which represent the
thread when the pencil is at <i>m</i> or <i>m′</i>, are together equal to
the larger axis of the ellipse. These lines, and we may
imagine an infinite number of such, are called <i>radii
vectores</i>. The distance of the foci, <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span>, from the
centre, <i>c</i>, is called the <em>eccentricity</em> of the ellipse. It is
evident that the smaller the eccentricity is, the nearer
the figure approaches to that of the circle. The superficies
of the ellipse is found by multiplying the two half
axes, <i>ac</i> and <i>dc</i>, by each other, and this product by the
number 3·14.</p>

<p>The <em>Diagonal Scale</em> is shown in the margin.
It is used to make diagrams so as to bring the relative
distances before the eye. The larger divisions represent,
it may be, miles, or any given distance; the
figures on the left side tenths, and the upper range
hundredths of a mile. So a measurement from <span class="smcap lowercase">Z</span> to
<span class="smcap lowercase">Z´</span> will represent two miles, we may say, with so many
tenths and hundredths.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_477c.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 514.—Transit instrument.</div>
</div>

<p>The Transit instrument is due to Roemer, a
Danish astronomer. It consists of a telescope so constructed
as always to point to the meridian, and rotates
upon a hollow axis, directed east and west. At one end is a graduated
circle. The optical axis of the telescope
must be at exactly right angles
to the axis of the instrument; it will
then move on the meridian. There is
an eye-piece filled with two horizontal
and five vertical wires, very fine, the
latter at equal distances apart. The
star appears, and the time it takes to
cross is noted as it passes between
each wire, and the mean of all the
transits will be the transit on the meridian.
For if we add the times of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
all the transits across the wires, and divide by five the number of them
we shall get at a true result.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_478a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 515.—The eyepiece of transit instrument.</div>
</div>

<p>A good clock is also a necessary adjunct
for astronomical observations, and the
astronomical clocks and chronometers now
in use record the time with almost perfect
accuracy. The improvement in telescopes,
the use of micrometers, etc., have greatly
facilitated observations. In the transit clock
we have a most useful timekeeper, for the
ordinary clocks are not sufficiently accurate
for very close observations. The sidereal
time differs from solar time, and the twenty-four hours’ period is calculated
from the moment a star passes the meridian
until it passes it again. The sidereal day is
nearly four minutes shorter than the solar day,
and the sidereal clock marks twenty-four hours
instead of twelve, like the old dial at Hampton
Court Palace over the inner gate. The Chronograph
has also been useful to astronomers, for
by “pricking off” the seconds on a roller by
itself, the observer can mark on the same cylinder
the actual moment of transit across each
wire of the instrument, and on inspection the
exact moment of transit may be noted.</p>

<p>The <em>Equitorial</em> is another useful instrument, and by its means the whole
progress of a star can be traced. The Equitorial consists of a telescope fixed
so that when it has been pointed at a certain star a clock-work movement
can be set in motion, which exactly corresponds with the motion of the star
across the heavens, and so while the star moves from its rising to setting
it is under observation. Thus continuous observations maybe made of that
particular star or comet without any jerking or irregular movement.</p>

<p>We can thus see the uniform motion of the stars which go on in greater
or lesser circles as they are nearer to or farther from the pole; and with
the exception of the polar star, which, so far as we are concerned, may be
considered stationary, every star moves round from east to west—that is, from
the east of the polar star to the west of it, in an oblique direction. Therefore,
as Professor Airy remarks, “Either the heavens are solid, and go all of
a piece, or the heavens may be assumed to be fixed or immovable, and that
we and the earth are turning instead of them.”</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_478b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 516.—Astronomical quadrant.</div>
</div>

<p>The <em>Mural Circle</em> is another very useful instrument, and is used by
calling to aid the powers of reflection of quicksilver, in which a bright star
will appear below the horizon at the same angle as the real star above the
horizon, and thus the angular distance from the pole or the horizon of any
star can be calculated when we know the inclination of the telescope. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
Transit Circle is also used for this purpose, and is a combination of the transit
instrument with the circle. In all calculations allowance must be made for
refraction, for which a “Table of Refractions” has been compiled. From
the zenith to the horizon refraction increases. The effect of refraction can
be imagined, for when we see the sun apparently <em>touching</em> the horizon the
orb is really below it, for the refraction of the rays by the air apparently
raises the disc.</p>

<p>The clock and chronometer are both very useful as well as very common
objects, but a brief description of the pendulum and the clock may fitly close
our remarks upon astronomical apparatus and instruments. The telescope
has been already described in a previous portion of this work, so no more
than a passing reference to it has been considered necessary. We therefore
pass on to a consideration of the measurement of time, so important to all
astronomers and to the public generally.</p>

<p>Time was measured by the ancients by dividing the day and night
into twelve hours each, then by sun-dials and water-clocks, or <em>clepsydra</em>, and
sand-clocks. The stars were the timekeepers for night before any mechanical
means of measurement were invented.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What is the star now passing?—</div>
<div class="verse">The Pleiades show themselves in the east,</div>
<div class="verse">The eagle is soaring in the summit of heaven.”—<span class="smcap">Euripides.</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Sun-dials were in use in Elijah’s time, and the reference to the miracle
of the sun’s shadow going back on the dial as a guarantee to Hezekiah, will
be recalled at once by our readers. These dials were universal, and till
sunset answered the purpose. But the hours must have been very varying,
and on cloudy days the sun-dials were practically useless.</p>

<p>The water-clocks measured time by the dripping or flow of water, and
they were used to determine the duration of speeches, for orators were each
allotted a certain time if a number of debaters were present. This method
might perhaps be adapted to the House of Commons, and speaking by the
clock might supersede <i lang="fr">clôture</i>. We find allusions to these practices in the
orations of Demosthenes. Even this system was open to objection, for the
vases were frequently tampered with, and an illiberal or objectionable person
was mulcted of a portion of the water, while a generous or popular adversary
had his clepsydra brimming full. Some of these water-clocks were of elegant
design, and a Cupid marked the time with arrows on the column of the clock
of Ctesibius, while another weeping kept up the supply of water. The motive
power was the water, which filled a wheel-trough in a certain time, and when
full this trough turned over, and another was filled. The wheel revolved once
in six days; and by a series of pinions and wheels the movements were communicated
more slowly to the pillar on which the time was marked for 360
days, or with other arrangements for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The repeating of psalms by monks also marked the time, for by
practice a monk could tell pretty accurately how many paternosters or other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
prayer he could repeat in sixty seconds. At the appointed hour he then
awoke the monastery to matins.</p>

<p>Nature also marks time for us—as, for example, the age of trees by means
of rings—one for each year; and horses’ teeth will guide the initiated to a guess
at the ages of the animals, while the horns of deer or cattle serve a like purpose.
But man required accuracy and minute divisions of time. He had recourse
therefore, to machinery and toothed wheels. Till the mechanical measurement
of time was adopted, the sunrise and sunset only marked the day, and the
Italians as well as Jews counted twenty-four hours from sunset to sunset.
This was a manifestly irregular method. To this day we have marked
differences of time in various places, and at Geneva we have Swiss and
French clocks keeping different hours according
to Paris or Berne “time.” This, of
course, is easily accounted for, and will be
referred to subsequently.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_480.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 517.—Clock movement.</div>
</div>

<p>We have read that the first clock in
England was put up in Old Palace yard in
1288, and the first application of the toothed-wheel
clock to astronomical purposes was in
1484, by Waltherus, of Nuremberg. Tycho
Brahé had a clock which marked the minutes
and seconds. If we had had any force independent
of gravitation which would act with
perfect uniformity, so that it would measure
an equal distance in equal spaces of time,
all the various appliances for chronometers
would have been rendered useless. In the
supposed case the simple mechanism, as shown
in the margin (fig. 517), would have sufficed.
The same effect would be produced by the
spring, were it possible that the spring by itself
would always uncoil with the same force.
But it will not do so: we therefore have to
check the unwinding of the cord and weight, for left to itself it would
rapidly increase in velocity; and if we likewise make an arrangement of
wheels whereby the spring shall uncoil with even pressure all the time, we
shall have the principle of the watch.</p>

<p>It is to Huygens that the employment of the pendulum in clocks is due,
and the escapement action subsequently rendered the pendulum available
in simple clocks, while the manner of making pendulums self-regulating
by using different metals, has rendered timepieces very exact. Of course
the length of a pendulum determines the movement, fast or slow; a long
pendulum will cause the hands of the clock to go slower, for the swing will
be a fraction longer. A common pendulum with the escapement is shown
(fig. 518). Each movement liberates a tooth of the escapement. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
arrangement of wheels sets the clock going. The forms of pendulum are
now very varied.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_481a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 518.—Pendulum and escapement.</div>
</div>

<p>But in watches the pendulum cannot
be used. The watch was invented by Peter
Hele, and his watches were called “Nuremburg
eggs” from their shape. The weight
cannot be introduced into a watch, and so
the spring and <em>fusee</em> are used. The latter is
so arranged that immediately the watch is
wound and the spring at its greatest tension,
the chain is upon the smallest diameter of the
fusee, and the most difficult to move. But
as the spring is relaxed the lever arm becomes
longer, and the necessary compensating power
is retained. Watches without a “<em>fusee</em>” have
a toothed arrangement beneath the spring.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 519.—Balance.</div>
</div>

<p>The <em>Pendulum</em>. A “simple” pendulum
is impossible to make, for we cannot
put the connecting line between the “bob”
and the clock-work out of consideration, so
“simple pendulums” are looked upon as
“mathematical abstractions.” The most
modern clocks have what is called a “deadbeat”
escapement,
and a compensating
pendulum.
Clocks are liable
to alter by reason
of the state of the
air and varying temperature, and until all our clocks are placed <i lang="la">in vacuo</i>
we must be content to have them lose or gain a little. There is a magnet
arrangement by which the Greenwich Observatory clocks keep time by
compensation, corresponding with the fall or rise of the syphon barometer
attached to it. The description need not be added. We may here state that
detailed descriptions of all the instruments
used in the Observatory, together with full
information as to their use, will be found
in a very interesting work by Mr. Lockyer,
entitled “Stargazing,” to which we are indebted
for some corrections in our summary.</p>

<p>We have spoken of solar time and
sidereal time, and no doubt someone will
inquire what is meant by mean time—an
expression so constantly applied to the
Greenwich clock time. Stellar time, we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
seen, corresponds to the daily revolution of a star or stars. Solar time is
regulated by the sun, and this is the astronomical time generally observed,
except for sidereal investigations. But the sun is not always regular; the
orbit of the earth causes this irregularity partly. The earth moves faster in
winter than in summer, so the sun is sometimes a little fast and sometimes
a little slow. Astronomers therefore strike an average, and calculate upon a
<span class="smcap">Mean Sun</span>, or uniform timekeeper. Mean time and true (apparent) time
are at some periods the same—viz., on the 15th of April, on the 14th of
June, on the 31st of August, and on the 24th of December. Twice it is
after, and twice before it. The time occupied by this “mean” sun passing
from the meridian and its return to it, is a mean solar day, and clocks and
chronometers are adjusted by it.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours represents a complete revolution of the heavenly
bodies. The mean solar time is 23<sup>h</sup> 56´ 4·091″, while twenty-four hours of
mean time are equal to 24<sup>h</sup> 3´ 56·55″ of sidereal time. The difference
between the times is given by Dr. Newcomb as follows, and is called the

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Measurement of Distances.</span></p>

<p>Before passing to consider the planetary system we must say a few words
respecting the manner of ascertaining the distances of inaccessible objects,
and by so doing, we shall arrive at an idea how the immense distances
between the sun (and the planets) and the earth have been so accurately
arrived at. To do this we must speak of <em>parallax</em>, a very unmeaning word
to the general reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Parallax is simply the difference between the directions of an object
when seen from two different positions. Now we can illustrate this by a
very simple method, which we have often tried as a “trick,” but which has
been very happily used by Professor Airy to illustrate the doctrine of
parallax. We give the extract in his own words:—</p>

<p>“If you place your head in a corner of a room, or on a high-backed
chair, and if you close one eye and allow another person to put a lighted
candle upon a table, and if you then try to snuff the candle with one eye
shut, you will find you cannot do it.... You will hold the snuffers too
near or too distant—you cannot form any idea of the distance. But if you
open the other eye, or if you move your head sensibly you are enabled to
judge of the distance.” The difference of direction between the eyes, which
is so well known to all, is ready a parallax. It can also be illustrated by
the diagram herewith.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_483b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 523.—Parallax.</div>
</div>

<p>If two persons, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> (fig. 523), from different stations, observe the
same point, <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>, the visual lines naturally meet in
the point, <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>, and form an angle, which is called
the angle of <em>parallax</em>. If the eye were at <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>,
this angle would be the angle of vision, or the
angle under which the base line, <span class="smcap lowercase">A C</span>, of the two
observers appears to the eye. The angle at <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span> also expresses the apparent
magnitude of <span class="smcap lowercase">A C</span> when viewed from <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>, and this apparent magnitude is
called the <em>parallax</em> of <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>.</p>

<p>Let <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span> represent the moon, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> the centre of the earth represented by the
circle, then <span class="smcap lowercase">A C</span> is the parallax of the moon; that is, the apparent magnitude
the semi-diameter of the earth would have if seen from the moon. If the
moon be observed at the same time from <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, being then on the horizon, and
from the point <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, being then in the zenith, and the visual line of which when
extended passes through the centre of the earth, we obtain, by uniting the
points, <span class="smcap lowercase">A C M</span>, by lines, the triangle, <span class="smcap lowercase">A C M</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="smcap lowercase">A M</span>, the tangent of the circle stands at right angles to the
radius, <span class="smcap lowercase">A C</span>, the angle at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> is a right angle, and the magnitude of the angle at
<span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> is found by means of the arc, <span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span>, the distance of the two observers from
each other. As soon, however, as we are acquainted with the magnitude of
two angles of a triangle, we arrive at that of the third, because we know that
all the angles of a triangle together equal two right angles (180°). The
angle at <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>, generally called the moon’s parallax, is thus found to be fifty-six
minutes and fifty-eight seconds. We know that in the right-angled triangle
<span class="smcap lowercase">M C A</span>, the measure of the angle, <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span> = 56´ 58″, and also that <span class="smcap lowercase">A C</span>, the semi-diameter
of the earth = 3,964 miles. This is sufficient, in order by trigonometry,
to obtain the length of the side, <span class="smcap lowercase">M C</span>; that is, to find the moon’s
distance from the earth. <span class="smcap lowercase">A C</span> is the sine of the angle, <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>, and by the table
the sine of an angle of 56´ 58″ is equal to 1652/100000; or, in other words, if
we divide the constant, <span class="smcap lowercase">M C</span>, the distance of the moon, into 100,000 equal
parts, the sine, <span class="smcap lowercase">A C</span>, the earth’s semi-diameter = 1,652 of these parts. And
this last quantity being contained 60 times in 100,000, the distance of the
moon from the earth is equal to 60 semi-diameters of the earth, or
60 × 3964 = 237,840 miles.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_484.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 524.—Parallax explained.</div>
</div>

<p>In a similar way the parallax of the sun has been found = 8″·6, and
the distance of the sun from the earth to be 91,000,000 miles.</p>

<p>Let us first see how we can obtain the distance of any inaccessible or
distant object. We have already mentioned an experiment, but this method
is by a calculation of angles. The three angles of a triangle, we know, are
equal to two right angles; that is an axiom which cannot be explained
away. We first establish a base line; that is, we plant a pole at one point,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, and take up our position at another point, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, at some distance in a
straight line, and measure that distance very carefully. By means of the
theodolite we can calculate the angles which our eye, or a supposed line
drawn from our eye to the top of the object (<span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>) we wish to find the distance
of, makes with that object. We now have an imaginary triangle with the
length of one side, <span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span>, known, and all the angles known; for if all three
angles are equal to 180°, and we have calculated the angles at the base, we
can easily find the other. We can then complete our triangle on paper to
scale, and find out the length of the side of the triangle by measurement;
that is the distance between our first position, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, and the object, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>. It is of
course necessary that all measurements should be <em>exact</em>, and the line we
adopt for a base should bear some relative proportion to the distance at
which we may guess the object to be.</p>

<p>In celestial measurements two observers go to different points of the
earth, and their distance in a straight line is known, and the difference of the
latitudes. By calling the line between the observers a base line, a figure
may be constructed and angles measured; then by some abstruse calculation
the distance between the centre of the earth and the centre of the moon may
be ascertained. The mean distance is sixty times the radius of the earth.
The measurement of the sun’s distance is calculated by the observations of
the transit of Venus across his disc, a phenomenon which will again occur on
6th December, 1882, and on 8th June, 2004, the next transit will take
place; there will be no others for a long time after 2004.</p>

<p>All astronomical observations are referred to the centre of the earth,
but of course can only be viewed from the surface, and correction is made.
In the cut above, let <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> be the earth and <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> a point on the surface. From <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>
the stars, <i>a</i> <i>b</i> <i>c</i> <i>d</i>, will be seen in the direction of the dotted lines, and be
projected to <i>e</i> <i>i</i> <i>k</i> <i>l</i> respectively. But from the centre of the earth they
would appear at <i>e</i> <i>f</i> <i>g</i> <i>h</i> correctly. The angles formed by the lines at <i>b</i> <i>c</i> <i>d</i>
are the parallactic angles, <i>f</i> <i>i</i> <i>g</i> <i>h</i> and <i>h</i> <i>l</i> show the parallax. An object on
the zenith thus has no parallax. (<i>See</i> fig. 524.)</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 526.—Planets compared with a quarter of the sun.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gravitation</span> is the force which keeps the planets in their orbits, and this
theory, perfected by Newton, was partially known to Kepler. Newton
brought this idea into practical shape, and applied it mathematically. We
know that every object in the world tends to attract every other object in
proportion to the quantity of matter of which each consists. So the sun
attracts the planets, and they influence him in a minor degree. Likewise the
moon and our earth reciprocally attract each other. But as the sun’s mass
is far greater than the masses of the planets he influences them more, and
could absorb them all without inconvenience or disturbance from his centre
of gravity. We have, in a former portion of this work, spoken of the law of
universal gravitation, which is the mutual attraction of any two bodies to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
other, is directly proportioned to their <em>masses</em> (not size), and inversely to the
square of their distances apart.</p>

<p>This law operates amongst the heavenly bodies, and it is to the never-changing
action of gravitation that the planets are kept in their places. Let
us see how this is effected. We have read of force, and motion, and rest.
Every body will remain at rest unless force compels it to change its position,
and it will then go on for ever in a straight path unless something stops it.
But if this body be acted on simultaneously by two forces in different
directions, it will go in the direction of the greater force. Two equal forces
will tend to give it an intermediate direction, and an equal opposing force
will stop it. The last axiom but one—viz., the two equal forces in
different, not opposing directions, gives us the key to the curving line of
the planetary motions. Were it not for the attraction of the sun the
planets would fly off at a tangent; while, on the other hand, were not
the impelling force as great as it is, they would
fall into the sun. Thus they take an intermediate
line, and circle round the centre of the solar system—the
<span class="smcap">Sun</span>.</p>

<p>The solar system consists of the sun and the
planets which revolve in space around him. These
stars are called planets because they move in the
heavens. We shall see that they have certain motions—going
from east to west, from west to east, and
sometimes they appear to be quite motionless.
This change of place, appearing now at one side
of the sun and now at another, has given them their
title of “wanderers” (planets). Besides the planets
there are comets and meteors, asteroids and satellites,
all circling round the sun in more or less regular
orbits. And there must be families of comets, and
whole systems of meteors that have not yet appeared
to us, and which make up the comets, as has been lately suggested.</p>

<p>Five planets were known to the ancients, and were named after
gods and a goddess: <span class="smcap">Mercury</span>, <span class="smcap">Venus</span>, <span class="smcap">Mars</span>, <span class="smcap">Jupiter</span>, <span class="smcap">Saturn</span>. In later
years a great number were discovered. We must, however, confine ourselves
to the consideration of the principal ones, eight in number, including our own
<span class="smcap">Earth</span>, <span class="smcap">Uranus</span> and <span class="smcap">Neptune</span> completing the list. Of these <span class="smcap">Venus</span> and
<span class="smcap">Mercury</span> are the inferior, or interior planets moving between us and the
sun. <span class="smcap">Mars</span>, <span class="smcap">Jupiter</span>, <span class="smcap">Saturn</span>, <span class="smcap">Uranus</span>, and <span class="smcap">Neptune</span> are superior, or
exterior, and pass quite round the heavens. All the planets are spheroids,
and vary greatly in their magnitude, as will be seen by the illustration
(fig. 528), the largest body being the sun. Mercury, Mars, and Venus, are
not so large as the Earth. The other principal planets are considerably
larger than our globe.</p>

</div>

<p>Mercury is the smallest of the planets, Venus being nearly as large as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
the earth. Then comes Mars, which, though smaller than Venus, is larger
than Mercury. Jupiter is the largest of all—the giant amongst planets, as
Jove was the ruler of the gods of mythology. Saturn comes next, though
much smaller than Jupiter, but bigger than all the rest together. Next
Uranus, then Neptune, larger than Uranus, but farther away from us. We
shall speak more in detail about these in their order separately.</p>

<p>Altogether there are a great number of planets and asteroids, which
latter are minor planets circulating outside the orbit of Mars. They have
nearly all classical names, such as Juno, Ceres, Vesta, Flora, Ariadne, Pallas,
Pomona, Thalia, etc., and are all at distances from the sun ranging between
200,000,000 and 300,000,000 of miles, the periods of sidereal revolution
ranging from 1,100 to 3,000 days, so their years must be from four times to
nine times as long as ours. Altogether about two hundred of the minor
planets have been discovered, and they are all very much smaller than the
earth; some, indeed, being very tiny—only a few miles in diameter, but very
massive. They do not appear to possess any satellites—at least, none have
been discovered, for such very small bodies as they must be, supposing they
exist, would be quite invisible even with our perfected instruments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satellites</span>, however, or “planetary moons,” as they are sometimes
designated, are plainly perceived attending upon the great planets. There
are twenty of these at present under observation. One we are all familiar
with, and the moon, <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>, lends a beauty to our nights which no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
light that we can enjoy or command can ever do. It is remarkable that
only this moon is specially mentioned in the Bible in connection with the
sun. The stars are usually grouped, although, of
course, the sun and moon are equally “stars” in
the firmament. Mars possesses two moons and
Jupiter four; Uranus also rejoices in the latter
number; Neptune, like the Earth, has only one.
It is reserved for Saturn to outstrip all the rest in
his attendants, for no less than eight satellites wait
upon that enormous planet. No doubt there are
many more of these moons to be found, and every
year will doubtless bring us further knowledge
respecting them. Mars’ moons were only discovered
very lately (in 1877), although they were known to exist; but
being very small, unlike the others,
they were missed. So we may conclude
that the remaining satellites will
remain for some time undiscovered,
even if they actually are in existence.
Jupiter’s moons are supposed to be
as large as our own moon; Neptune
and Uranus can boast of equally-sized
attendants. But it is impossible
to estimate the riches of astronomical
lore which are beyond our ken. Millions
of tiny planets are believed to exist, but their immense distance from
us precludes all investigation. We are but mites in the scale.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_490c.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 535.—Meteor shower.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Meteors</span>, to which we have already referred, are small erratic bodies
rushing through the planetary system, and getting hot in the process, appear
in the atmosphere surrounding our earth as “shooting stars.” Some of these
falling bodies have reached the
earth, and several can be seen in
the British Museum. Numbers,
of course, are burnt up before
they reach us, and who can tell
what destruction such a catastrophe
may represent, or whether
it be or be not an inhabited
world which has thus plunged
to destruction by fire? They
are of a metallic or stony nature.
On certain nights in August and
November it has been calculated
that these meteors will appear. They fall from certain constellations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
apparently on these occasions, and are called after their names—as Leonides,
from Leo, in the November displays.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_491a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 536.—Star shower.</div>
</div>

<p>The star-showers at times attain the dimensions of a very beautiful
display of rockets. Millions of them rush round the sun; and when, as
occasionally happens, our earth
comes near them, we have (as in
1866) a grand display of celestial
“fireworks.” But the individuals
composing the mass of falling stars
are very small. These meteors are
very much like the comets we last
year had an example of, and it
has been lately suggested that there
is a great degree of affinity between
the comets and the meteors;—in
fact, that a comet is merely an
aggregation of meteors. They
have been supposed to be bodies of
burning gas. Their mass is very great, and their brilliant tails are many
millions of miles in extent.</p>

<p>Comets are thus distinguished by their tails, and differ very much in
their orbits from the planets. The latter are direct in their wanderings, but
comets are most irregular and eccentric. The name bestowed upon comets
is from the Greek <i lang="el">Kome</i>, hair; for when the comet recedes from the sun the
“tail” may be said to come out of the head, and appear as a hair in front,
so to speak. But though all comets have tails, there are many luminous
bodies (classed with comets) which have no tails.</p>

The calculation for its actual appearance was made by Claivant, and the
expected visitor passed the perihelion in March 1759. This comet, on its
appearance at Constantinople, is said to have caused much consternation,
and Christians regarded it as a “sign,” for the Turks had just then captured
Constantinople, and were threatening Europe. Pious people included it in
their supplications for deliverance from their most dreaded enemies, and
“Lord, save us from the Turks, the devil, and the comet,” was a common
prayer.</p>

<p>There have been several very beautiful comets. Encke’s, Coggia’s, etc.,
and the comet of 1858 (Donatis) must be in the recollection of middle-aged
readers. Others came in 1861 and 1874. In 1881 two comets appeared.
Some comets of antiquity were very remarkable, and are reputed to have
equalled the sun in magnitude. One tail is usually supposed to be the
distinguishing mark of a comet, but in 1774 one appeared with six tails,
arranged something like a fan. Sometimes the tail is separated from the
head. Of the actual consistency of comets we cannot give any lengthened
details. They apparently consist of elements similar to the meteors—namely,
of solid masses, and have been supposed to be aggregations of meteors.
Some appear at regular intervals, and their approach can be determined
with accuracy. Of course we only see those which are attracted by the sun,
or those which revolve in the solar system. There must be thousands of
other comets which we never see at all.</p>

<p>The diagram (fig. 540 in the next page) represents a portion of the path
of the comet of 1680. This visitor pursued its course for two months at
a velocity of 800,000 miles an hour. The tail was estimated to extend
123,000,000 of miles, and a length of 60,000,000 of miles was emitted in
two days. When this great comet was approaching the sun, or its perihelion,
as such approach is termed, three minutes more would have seen it
rush into the orb had its enormous pace been slackened, but as it was pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>ceeding
so rapidly, and being just then 144,000 miles away, it escaped.
We can scarcely estimate the results
of such a collision. This comet appeared
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 34, and again at intervals
of about 575 years. It may be expected
in 2255. It is to Halley that
the discovery of the elliptical orbits
of comets is due.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 539.—Path of Biela’s Comet.</div>
</div>

<p>M. Biela’s comet was the cause of much anxiety in 1832, for
a collision with the earth was apprehended. Fortunately a month
intervened between the period at which the comet was expected at a
certain place in the system and the earth’s arrival at that spot, so,
as it happened, about 60,000,000 of miles intervened. We cannot say
what the exact effect of such a collision would be, but some wonderful
atmospheric phenomena and increased temperature would certainly result
from the contact. Now the comet is supposed to have an effect upon the
vintage, as “comet” wines are regarded with much favour. If comets, as
is believed, do consist partly of solid particles, a collision might
be unpleasant; but the weight is, as a rule, a mere nothing compared
to their vapoury volume, which is enormous. That the tails must be of
a very attenuated medium is evident, as we can see the stars through
them, and we know that a very thin cloud will obscure a star. The
“menacing” comet, mentioned in the <cite>Spectator</cite> February 1881, will
not do much damage, so the scare was needless, as Mr. Proctor has
explained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aerolites</span>, or “Meteorites,” are falling
bodies (meteors), which reach the earth in solid
form. The greater mass of falling stars are
burnt up ere they reach us, or are dissipated in
space. But many instances of aerolites descending
might be adduced. They usually consist
of metals, such as iron and nickel mixed with sulphur, magnesia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
and silica. The theory concerning falling stars has been already

<div class="caption">Fig. 541.—The heavens as seen from Saturn.</div>
</div>

<p>We have thus far taken a brief general view of the solar system, with
a few of the phenomena of the heavens. Our next step will be to consider
the sun, the planets, and the asteroids, according to the order of magnitude.
The asteroids we cannot consider separately, but the sun, moon, earth, and
the principal planets will yield us much interesting information as we
examine them more closely. We shall then, as far as possible, look into
the domain of the fixed stars, constellations, and the nebulæ, commenting,
as we proceed, upon the varied celestial and terrestrial phenomena
connected with the movements of the heavenly bodies. As is due to the
great centre of our system, we will commence with the <span class="smcap">Sun</span>. But before
proceeding to do so, we must say a few words about the motion of the
heavenly bodies—that is, the <em>apparent</em> motion of the rising and setting of
the sun and stars.</p>

<p>The attentive observation of the starry heavens, even during a single
night, will convince us that all the visible stars describe circles which are the
smaller, the nearer the stars are to a certain point
of the heavens, <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span> (fig. 542). In close proximity to
this point there is a tolerably bright star, called
the <em>Pole Star</em>, which has scarcely any motion, but
appears to the eye as always occupying the same
position. Hence a line, <span class="smcap lowercase">PP´</span>, drawn from this star,
through the centre of the earth, <i>c</i>, represents the
axis around which all the heavenly bodies perform
their apparent motions. The part of the celestial
axis, <span class="smcap lowercase">PP´</span>, passing through the earth, is the earth’s
axis; the north pole, of which <i>p</i> is on the same
side as the pole star, and the south pole, <i>p´</i>, is on the opposite side.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_494b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 542.—Celestial axis.</div>
</div>

<p>We have, therefore, by the aid of the stars, determined the position of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
the earth’s axis, and by this latter we can assign to the equator its proper
place. For if <i>pp´</i> be the earth’s axis, <i>aq´</i> is the greatest circle drawn round
the earth, equally distant from both poles, and the plane of which cuts the
earth’s axis at right angles.</p>

<p>Furthermore, let us suppose the plane of the equator to be extended
till it reach the celestial concave; we thus find the place of the celestial
equator, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">Q</span>, or <em>equinoctial</em>, as it is generally termed in opposition to the
equator, which always means the terrestrial equator. The equinoctial
divides the heavens into the northern and southern hemispheres. We cannot
actually describe the equinoctial and make it visible, but we can imagine
its line of direction by observing those stars through which it passes.</p>

<p>We are now in a condition to assign to an observer different stations
in relation to the earth’s axis on the earth’s surface, which will essentially
modify the aspects under which celestial phenomena are represented. One
of these stations may be supposed to be at one of the two poles, for
example, at <i>p</i>, or at any one point of the equator, as at <i>a</i>, or, finally, on
any portion of the surface of the earth which lies between the pole and the
equator, as, for example, <i>o</i>.</p>

<p class="hang">MOTION OF THE SUN—THE SEASONS—CHARACTER OF THE SUN—SUNSPOTS—ZODIACAL
LIGHT.</p>


<p>Suppose that we rise early in the morning we shall, as the reader will say
see the sun rise—that is, he appears to us to rise as the earth rotates. By
the accompanying diagram (fig. 544) we can understand how Sol makes his
appearance, and how he comes up again; not, it will be observed, after the
manner stated by the Irishman, who declared that the sun “went down, and ran
round during the night when nobody was looking.” The earth rotates from
west to east, and so the sun appears to move from east to west. If we look
at the diagram we shall see that after rising at <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>, the sun advances towards
the meridian in an oblique arc to <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, the highest or
culminating point—midday. He then returns, descending
to <span class="smcap lowercase">W</span>; this path is the diurnal arc. At
<span class="smcap lowercase">Q</span> similarly, during his passage in the nocturnal arc,
he reaches the lowest or inferior culmination. <span class="smcap lowercase">HH´</span>
is the meridian.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_496a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 544.—Sun’s motion.</div>
</div>

<p>On the 21st of March, this path brings the sun
on the “ equinoctial” line mentioned at the close of
the last chapter. Day and night are then of equal
duration as the arcs are equal. So this is the <em>Vernal</em>
(or spring) <em>Equinox</em>. Some weeks after the sun is
at midday higher up at <span class="smcap lowercase">S´</span>, so the diurnal arc being longer, the day is longer,
(<span class="smcap lowercase">Z</span> is the zenith, <span class="smcap lowercase">Z´</span> is the nadir, <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">P´</span> is the celestial axis). From that time he
descends <em>again</em> towards the equinoctial to the autumnal equinox, and so on,
the diurnal arc becoming smaller and smaller until
the <em>winter solstice</em> is reached (<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>).</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_496b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 545.—The ecliptic.</div>
</div>

<p>From what has been previously said, it is evident
that the sun has a twofold apparent motion—viz.,
a circular motion obliquely ascending from the horizon,
which is explained by the rotation of the earth,
and by our position, <i>o</i>, to the earth’s axis, <span class="smcap">p</span> <span class="smcap">p´</span>, and
also by a rising and setting motion between the
solstitial points, <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">S´</span>, which causes the inequality
of the days and nights. Independently of the daily
motion of the sun, we observe that at the summer solstice, on the 21st of
June, at midday, the sun is at <span class="smcap lowercase">S´</span>, and one half year later—viz., on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
21st of December, at midnight, the sun is at <i>s</i>, from which he arrives again
in the space of half a year at <span class="smcap lowercase">S´</span>; so we are able to represent this annual
motion of the sun by a circle, the diameter of which is the line, <span class="smcap lowercase">S´</span> <i>s</i>. This
circle is called the <em>Ecliptic</em>.</p>

<p>The plane of the ecliptic, <span class="smcap lowercase">S´</span> <i>s</i>, cuts the plane of the equinoctial, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">Q</span>, at an
angle of 23&frac12;°, and the axis of the ecliptic, <span class="smcap lowercase">S″´</span> <i>s″</i>, makes the same angle with
the axis of the heavens, <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span>. The two parallel circles, <span class="smcap lowercase">S´</span> <i>s´</i> and <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> <i>s</i>, include
a zone extending to both sides of the equinoctial, and beyond which the sun
never passes. These circles are called the <em>Tropics</em>, from τρέπω, <em>I turn</em>, because
the sun turns back at these points, and again approaches the equinoctial.
The parallel circles, <span class="smcap lowercase">S″</span> <i>s″</i>, and <span class="smcap lowercase">S″´</span> <i>s″´</i>, described by the poles of the ecliptic,
<span class="smcap lowercase">S″´</span> <i>s″</i>, about the celestial poles, <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span>, are called the <em>arctic</em> and <em>antarctic circles</em>.</p>

<p>Whenever the sun crosses the equinoctial, there is the equinox; but the
points of intersection are not invariably the same every year. There is a
gradual westerly movement, so it is a little behind its former crossing place
every year. (<i>See</i> diagram, fig. 547.)</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 546.—The Seasons.</div>
</div>

<p>[This is the “Precession of the Equinoxes,” because the time of the
equinoxes is hastened, but it is really a retrograde movement. Hipparchus
discovered this motion, which amounts to about fifty seconds in a year.
So the whole revolution will be completed in about 28,000 years.]</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_497b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 547.—Precession of Equinoxes.</div>
</div>

<p>It is obvious, then, that the sun is the most
important star in the universe; and when we come
to speak about the earth we shall consider the seasons,
etc., more fully. Now we must endeavour to explain
what the sun is like, and this can only be done with
specially darkened glasses, for a look at the sun through
an ordinary telescope may result in great, if not permanent,
injury to the eye.</p>

<p>The sun is not solid so far as we can tell. It is a
mass of “white-hot” vapour, and is enabled to shine by reason of its own
light, which the planets and stars cannot do; they shine only by the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>’s
reflected light. So we may conclude the sun to be entirely gaseous, but,
thanks to the recent researches in <em>spectrum analysis</em> (already explained), by
which the light of the sun has been examined by means of the spectroscope,
and split up into its component colours, Mr. Lockyer and other scientists
have discovered that a number of elements (metals) exist in the sun in a
fused, or rather vapourous state, in consequence of the intense heat. Hydrogen
exists in the sun, with other gases unknown to us here, and many metals,
discovered by their <em>spectra</em>, which are the same under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>The sun is supposed to be spherical in shape,—not like the earth, flattened
at the poles,—and to be composed of materials similar to what the earth is
composed of, and what it would be if it were as hot as the sun is. Thus we
can argue by analogy from the <em>spectra</em> of earthly elements, that, as the sun
and star light gives us similar <em>spectra</em>, the heavenly bodies are composed
of the same elements as our globe. We can thus form our opinion of the
sun’s constitution. Mr. Neisen says:—</p>

<p>“With the aid, therefore, of the additional information given us by the
spectroscope, it is not very difficult to form a true idea of the probable condition
of the surface of the sun, which is all that we can see. It is the upper-lying
strata of a very dense atmosphere of very high temperature—an
atmosphere agitated by storms, whirlwinds, and cyclones of all kinds,
traversed by innumerable currents, and now and then broken by violent
explosions. Above the brilliant surface which we see is a less dense and
somewhat cooler upper stratum, which, though hot enough to shine quite
brightly, is quite invisible in the presence of the brighter strata beneath it.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_498.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 548.—Sun spots.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sun Spots</span>, as they are generally called, are hollows in the sun’s
vapoury substance, and are of enormous extent; and there are brilliant places
near those spots, which are termed <em>faculæ</em>. These spots have been observed
to be changing continuously, and passing from east to west across the sun,
and then to come again at the east to go over the same space again. Now
this fact has proved that the sun turns round upon his axis, and although
he does not move as we imagine, from east to west, round the earth, the orb
<em>does</em> move—in fact, the sun has three motions: one on his axis; secondly,
a motion about the centre of gravity of the solar system, and a progressive
movement towards the planet Hercules.</p>

<p>If we examine the surface of the sun through a proper telescope, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
shall find that the even surface we can plainly distinguish at sunset is
marked, and the brightness is greater towards the centre of the orb. We
can perceive various irregularities; we shall find spots, faculæ (little torches),
etc. These spots were discovered by Galileo and other astronomers, and
were, as we have stated, found to be surface markings, and not a series of
bodies passing between the earth and the sun. The rotation of the sun was
measured, and it was found that the orb revolved in about 25-1/3 days, and in
such a manner as to be slightly inclined to the plane of the ecliptic.</p>

<p>Herschel observed a spot at least 50,000 miles in diameter, which is
more than six times the diameter of the earth. The sun spots are observed
to be constantly changing, and are naturally observed differently as the
revolution proceeds. The dark pole, or “nucleus” (<em>umbra</em>), as it is called, is
surrounded by a less dark surface called the <em>penumbra</em>, but the umbra is
not really dark; it is extremely bright when viewed alone, as has been
proved by Professor Langley, while the heat is even greater in proportion.
But the umbra of a sun spot must be below the level of the penumbra, for the
shape changed as the sun revolved on its axis. The penumbra was wider
on the side nearest the edge of the solar disc, and the umbra may be due to
the uprushing or downpouring of gas or vapour like “whirlpools in the solar
atmosphere.”</p>

<p>Near the sun spots the long streaks, or <em>faculæ</em>, are often observed by the
borders of the disc, and a transition of the luminous part of the photosphere<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
into darkness has been observed, and bright bridges crossing the spots,
and then gradually getting dark, were seen by M. Chacomac. The sun spots
vary in direction, but the same general course is continued. Sometimes they
describe curves, sometimes lines.</p>

<div class="caption"> Fig. 549.—Direction of sun spots.</div>
</div>

<p>During solar eclipses the sun exhibits what are termed “red prominences,”
which are the luminous vapours
existing around the sun. When the orb is
eclipsed, we can see the bright-coloured
vapours shooting out from underneath the
dark shadow, and this light is termed the
“coronal atmosphere”; the vapours are called
the sun’s <em>chromosphere</em>. In the coronal atmosphere
are certain curious shapes of
vapour thrown up, and frequently changing,—projecting,
in fact, from the gaseous envelope.
These red prominences were first
observed in 1842, and in 1851 it was proved
that they appertained to the sun, for the moon hid them as the eclipse began.
Before the prominences were discovered, the red light surrounding the solar
disc was known, and called the “sierra” (now chromosphere), or chromatosphere.
“The luminosity of these prominences is intense,” says Secchi, “and
they rise often to a height of 80,000 miles, and occasionally to more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
twice that; then bending back, they fall again upon the sun like the jets of our
fountains. Then they spread into figures resembling gigantic trees, more or
less rich in branches.” We give some illustrations of the appearances of
these prominences.</p>

<p>The <em>zodiacal light</em> is often observed. It is a glow, and frequently of
a rosy tint. It may be seen in England in March or April before sunset,
or in the autumn before sunrise; and it is doubtful whether it be a terrestrial
or an extra-terrestrial light—a lens-shaped object surrounding the sun.
Some philosophers maintain that the light is caused by multitudes of minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
bodies travelling round the sun; but Herr Gronemann has lately fully discussed
the observations, and the drift of his contention is under stated:—</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_501.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 551.—Solar prominences.</div>
</div>

<p>There are valid observations against two items in the support of the
old theory—viz., the affirmed connection of the evening and morning cones
seen on the same night (if the corresponding sides be prolonged), and the
participation of the cones in the daily motion of the heavens. The zodiacal
light is sometimes seen when daylight has not yet disappeared; and, on the
other hand, it sometimes fails to appear, though there is complete darkness.
There would seem to be a real lengthening and shortening. It has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
observed by Schiaparelli, that the light is much more difficult to make out
when it passes through the meridian, than when it is only 30° above the
horizon, and is less easily seen when the air is clearest than when a sort
of mist is present. Indeed, the bright parts of the Milky Way may be seen
to be weakened by mist, while the zodiacal light at the same height is
unaffected. The zodiacal light has temporary variations of light intensity,
and it shows from time to time remarkable changes of form and position, so
sudden and short as to be hard to explain on the planetary hypothesis.
The elongations of the cones show a half-yearly period, which is independent
of the transparency of the air. The cone follows the observer northwards or
southwards, so that there is no parallactic action; and this peculiarity (so
adverse to the extra-terrestrial hypothesis) cannot be explained by reflection
or absorption of light. As to spectroscopic observations, the author finds
(1) that the zodiacal light consists partly of proper light; (2) that its connection
with polar light is but secondary, temporary, and accidental; (3)
that the cause of the second phenomenon is such that it may strengthen the
zodiacal light and modify its spectrum; and (4) that the results of spectrum
analysis rank with other arguments tending to find the source of the zodiacal
light in the neighbourhood of the earth (like the polar light). Herr
Gronemann, then, thinks the zodiacal light a terrestrial phenomenon, though
he will not say that it cannot be influenced by cosmic action. He throws
out the suggestion that the cone may be a kind of optical illusion, arising
from some fine matter—gas or dust—being more accumulated near the
observer in one direction than another. The apparent length of the cone
might be conditioned by the conical shadow of the earth, and the changes of
length be due to cosmic and electric influences. In any case, there is need
of a more scientific theory than the old one.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 552.—On the sun’s disc.</div>
</div>

<p>We may conclude our brief notice of the great luminary to which we
are indebted for everything, by a <i lang="fr">resumé</i> of his distance from us, his diameter,
and a few other plain facts and figures. In the first place the actual
distance of the sun from the earth has never accurately been determined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
but perhaps the next transit of Venus will assist the observers to a nearer
estimate. It is quite sufficient for our purpose, however, to state that the
sun’s distance from the earth is 92,000,000 of miles. The distance
varies in winter and summer. In the former period the sun is <em>nearer</em> than
in summer, and yet as the rays strike over us, and pass us, as it were, we
feel less heat. When, as in summer, we are more in the focus of the rays,
we feel the greater heat.</p>

<p>We have already spoken of <em>parallax</em>, and it is by finding the solar
parallax that the distance of the sun from us is found. This parallax has not
been exactly ascertained, or rather authorities differ, and as difference of 0·01″
in the solar parallax means something over 100,000 miles of distance, it is
evident that exactness is almost impossible. If 8″·80 be settled as the solar
parallax, 92,880,000 miles is the distance of the sun from the earth. If
8″·88 be taken we have nearly 92,000,000 exactly.</p>

<p>The <em>volume</em> of the sun is 1,253,000 times that of the earth, and yet the
<em>density</em> of the former is only about one-fourth of the latter, so the attraction
of gravitation at the sun must be more than that of the earth’s surface
twenty-seven times. A body dropped near the surface of the sun would fall
436 feet in the first second, and have attained a velocity of ten miles a
minute at the end of the first second. The diameter of the sun depends
in our calculations upon its distance from the earth. If we suppose that to
be 92,880,000 miles, the diameter is 866,000 miles. If we take 91,000,000
of miles as the distance from the earth the diameter is 850,467 miles. The
sun makes (apparently) the circuit of the heavens in 365 days, 6 hours,
9 minutes, and 9·6 seconds; the transit from one vernal equinox to the
next being only 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 48·6 seconds, owing to the
precession of the equinoxes already mentioned.</p>

<p>When we consider the power and grandeur of the sun we may well feel
lost in the contemplation. The sun balances the planets and keeps them in
their orbits. He gives us the light and heat we enjoy, and coal-gas is
merely “bottled-up sunlight.” In darkness nothing will come to maturity.
We obtain rain and dew owing to the sun’s evaporative power; and no
action could go on upon earth without the sun; and yet we receive only about
1/2070650000 part of its heat and light.</p>

<p>As to the colour of the sun, Professor Langley states that it is really
blue, and not the white disc we see. The whiteness is due to the effect of
absorption exerted by the vapourous metallic atmosphere surrounding our
luminary; and if that atmosphere were removed, his colour would
change.</p>

<small>THE EARTH.</small></h2>

<p class="hang">FORM OF THE EARTH—MOTION OF THE GLOBE—RATE AND MANNER
OF PROGRESSION—LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE—THE SEASONS.</p>


<p>We have learnt from our books on Geography that the earth is shaped
like an orange,—that is, our globe is round and flattened slightly at the
“poles,” and we can easily see that the earth curves away, if we only try
the experiment mentioned in a foregoing chapter—viz., how far a person
standing (or lying) on the ground can see on a level. Our power of eyesight
is not limited to three or four miles, but a man of ordinary height
standing on the plain cannot see more than three miles, <em>because the earth is
curving away from him</em>.</p>

<p>We know that at the seaside we can see ships gradually appear and
disappear. When approaching us the masts and top-sails appear first, then
the main-sails, and then the ship itself. A sailor climbing up the mast can
see farther than the captain on deck, because he can see over the curve, as it
were. When the vessel is at a considerable distance we see her “hull
down” as it is termed,—that is, only her sails are visible to us, and at last
they disappear also. If we want any other proof that the earth is round
we can see when an eclipse takes place that the shadow on the moon is
circular. So we may be certain of one fact; the earth is round, it is a globe.
So much for the rotundity of the earth.</p>

<p>But the earth appears to us, except in very mountainous districts, as
being almost a plane. This is because of its extent; and even from very high
mountains we can only see a very small portion of the earth, and so, on a globe
sixteen inches in diameter, the highest hills would be only about 1/100 of an
inch, like a grain of sand.</p>

<p>The motion of the earth is known to most people, though as everything
upon the globe passes with it, and a relative fixity is apparent, this is, of
course, not real rest. The earth is moving from west to east at a tremendous
rate,—viz., nearly nineteen miles a second! We think a train at sixty miles
an hour a fast train; but what should we think of an express going more
than 68,000 miles an hour! Yet this is about the rate at which our globe
whirls around the sun. Her fastest pace is really 18·5 miles a second; the
least about one mile per second less.</p>

<p>That is one motion of the earth; the other is its motion on its axis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
If we send a skittle ball rolling we perceive it turns round as it proceeds.
So the earth rotates on its axis, <span class="smcap lowercase">N S</span>, in the accompanying diagram; the
extremities of the axis are called the <em>poles</em>. The line in the middle is the
equator, which is divided into 360 equal parts, each being 69-1/10 miles in
length; so there are 180 lines, or rings, drawn upon the globe from <span class="smcap lowercase">N</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>,
and these are <em>meridians</em>. In England the degrees are calculated from
the Greenwich meridian. We can thus obtain the distance of localities east
or west, as we may briefly show (fig. 554).</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_505a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 553.—Evidence of the spherical form of the earth.</div>
</div>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_505b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 554.—Latitude and Longitude.</div>
</div>

<p>The distance of any meridian from the first meridian is termed the
<em>longitude</em>, and it is employed in describing
the situation of a place on the earth’s surface.
Suppose <span class="smcap lowercase">L</span> (fig. 554) a city, its
longitude will be 30°, since it lies on a
meridian which is 30° from the first.
So, for example, the longitude of Oporto
is 8° 37´ west, Paris 2° 22´ east, Vienna
16° 16´ east, Bagdad 44° 45´ east, reckoned
from the meridian of Greenwich,
and so on. At the 180th degree we have
proceeded half round the globe, and reached
the farthest distance from the first meridian,
and are now on the opposite side of
the earth, and proceeding in a similar
manner in the opposite direction we get
west longitude.</p>

<p>It will readily be perceived that a knowledge of the longitude alone is
not sufficient to determine the situation of a place on the earth’s surface.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
When we say, for example, that the longitude of a place is 30°, it may lie
on any point whatever of the line, <span class="smcap lowercase">N L S</span>, on the whole hemisphere (fig. 554).
This point must therefore be determined more accurately, and hence the first
meridian is divided into 90 equal parts north and south of the equator
towards the poles. These are called <em>degrees of latitude</em>, and the lines
drawn through these round the globe, parallel to the equator, are called
circles or <em>parallels of latitude</em>, and diminish as they approach the poles.</p>

<p>Hence, by the <em>latitude</em> of a place we mean its distance from the
equator towards the poles, and we speak of north and south latitude
according as the place is situated in the northern or southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>So, for example, the point <span class="smcap lowercase">L</span> (fig. 554), which has 30° longitude and
60° N. latitude is in Sweden.</p>

<p>The latitude is also observable by ascertaining the altitude of the polar
star above the horizon when in the northern hemisphere. The longitude is
found by the chronometer; for if we know the time at Greenwich we can
calculate how far we are east or west of it by seeing whether the local
time be an hour (say) earlier or later, and that difference shows we are 15°
to the east or the west as the case may be.</p>

<p>The earth’s rotation, according to sidereal time, is less than solar time,
as we have seen, so we have 365 solar days and 366 sidereal days; so a
person going round the world gains or loses a day as he travels east or west
according to his reckoning, as compared with the reckoning of his friends at
home. We can easily ascertain the earth’s motion by watching the stars
rise and set. Now the path in which the earth moves is called an <em>ellipse</em>,—very
nearly a circle,—but it does not always move at the same rate exactly.
We will now look at the relations of the sun and the earth.</p>

<p>Let us take an example. Suppose we have a rod, at each end of which
we fix a ball (<i>see</i> diagram), and let one ball be three
times as large as the other, the common centre of
gravity will be at <i>c</i>, at one quarter of the distance
between the centres, and there the bodies will be in
equilibrium. If these masses be set spinning into space
they will revolve at that distance from each other,
the attraction of gravitation and the force in opposition
to it equalizing each other.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_506.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 555.—Earth and Sun.</div>
</div>

<p>The earth, as we know, proceeds with a tremendous
force around the sun, not in a circle,
remember, but in an ellipse or oval track, from which it never moves
year by year in any appreciable degree. Now what prevents this earth
of ours from rushing off by itself into space? Why should not the
earth fly away in a direct line? The reason is because the sun holds it
back. The force of the sun’s gravitation is just sufficient, or we may say
so enormously great, that it suffices to retain our globe and all the other
planets in their various orbits at the very same distance, and to counteract
the force which launches them through space. Therefore, as we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
already noticed when considering the sun, it is to that ruler of the day
that we are indebted for everything.</p>

<p>What would happen, then, if the earth were suddenly to increase her
velocity, or the sun to contract his mass?—We should be flung into infinite
space, and in a short time would be frozen up completely. Our present
diurnal course would probably proceed, but all life and existence would
cease as we whirled with distant planets through infinity.</p>

<p>Suppose, on the contrary, we were to stop suddenly. We have some
of us read in a foregoing part of this volume that heat is the motion of
molecules in ether, and that when a body strikes another heat is developed
by contact and friction. If the earth were to be stopped suddenly, “an
amount of heat would be developed sufficient to raise the temperature of a
globe of lead of the same size as the earth 384,000° of the Centigrade
thermometer. The greater part, if not the whole of our planet, would be
reduced to vapour”, as Professor Tyndall says.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_507.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 556.—Transit of earth across Sun, seen from Mars.</div>
</div>

<p>In the diagram (fig. 546, on page 497) we shall at once find the explanation
of the constantly-recurring seasons, and the amount of our globe which is
illuminated by the sun at various times. It will be easily understood that the
poles have six months day and six months night. When the earth is at an
equinox, one half of the surface is illuminated and the other half in shade,
therefore the days and nights are equal. But when the north pole turns
more and more towards the sun, the south pole is turning away from it in
the same ratio,—the days and nights respectively are getting longer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
longer, and at the north and south poles day and night are continuous, for
the small spaces round the poles are, during a certain period, wholly in sunshine
and shade respectively.</p>

<p>In March (in the diagram, fig. 546) we see that exactly one half of
the earth is illuminated, and the other is darkened. So in September, when
we have the opposite view. In June the earth is more inclined apparently
to the sun, and more of the surface is exposed to it, so the days are longer
in some parts. The opposite effect is visible in December.</p>

<p>The summer heat and winter cold are accounted for by the more or
less direct force of the sun’s rays, for the more the angle of incidence is
inclined the fewer rays reach the object; and if the rays fall at an angle of
60°, the heat is only half what it would be if they came vertically. When
the days are shortest the sun is lowest, and therefore gives less heat to the
earth at certain periods.</p>

<p>The wonderful precision which has adapted the position of the earth
on its axis, will be apparent from the illustration (fig. 557). Here we have a
table and some bottles, a candle to represent
the sun, and a ball of worsted and a
knitting-needle to represent the earth and
its axis. Suppose we place the ball in the
position at <i>a</i>, with its axis perpendicular
to the plane of the orbit. As the earth
would turn and go round the sun in this
supposed case, we should find the days and
nights equal, and the sun would quickly
scorch up the tropics, and the other portions
would have a never-changing spring
or winter all the year for ever. This would not be so pleasant, for variety
is the charm of nature, and the salt of life. So we may put <i>a</i> aside, as the
earth would be scarcely habitable under the supposed conditions, and try <i>b</i>.
Here we find the poles directed to the sun. The whole northern hemisphere
would thus be illuminated one half year, and the southern similarly;
such rapid changes from heat to cold and back again would not suit us. So
we fall back upon <i>c</i>, the actual appearance of the position of the earth, and
here we find all the most favourable circumstances existing for us. This
inclination gives rise to all the varied phenomena of the pleasant gradations
of heat and cold, summer and winter, the charming changes of season, and
the wonderful results of the ever-recurring days and nights, months and
years, as the earth spins round. So we see that the sun does not really rise
and set upon the earth; the globe rotates, and brings us into view of the
sun, and as we turn we lose his light.</p>

<p>In the foregoing brief description we have learnt some few facts concerning
our earth. We have ascertained that the planet we inhabit is
round; we have also seen that the earth moves around the sun and around
its own axis, and also that it moves at a tremendous rate; we know that that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
rate is just counterbalanced by the attraction of gravitation, and the course round
the sun gives us varying seasons, day and night. There are many subjects
relating to the earth which will be more properly included under Physical
Geography. We may here just add the diameter of the earth, and proceed
to inquire concerning the moon. The polar diameter of our globe is 7,899
miles; the equatorial diameter 7,925 miles. It is distant from the moon
238,500 miles. We will close this chapter with the letters and characters
of the Greek alphabet used in astronomical works to designate the stars.</p>

<small>THE MOON.</small></h2>

<p class="hang">WHAT IS IT LIKE?—MOON SUPERSTITIONS—DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON—PHASES—TIDES—ECLIPSES.</p>


<p>From the early days of childhood every man and woman has been familiar
with the moon. This satellite of earth has been domesticated, so to speak,
amongst us; and while the sun and other stars have been glorified in poetic
and prose effusions, the moon has been always more tenderly addressed.
The soft (reflected) light of our attendant moon is much more attractive
than the brilliancy of the greater light “that rules the day.” The moon is
regarded as our particular property, and has awakened an interest in our
minds since the time that we could, as we fancied, see the “Man in the
Moon.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_510.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 559.—The earth as seen from the moon.</div>
</div>

<p>In ancient times the moon was supposed to possess some light of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
own, and to be inhabited by immense creatures; and various theories continued
to be promulgated respecting her, until the telescope came into use,
and then astronomers began to find out many new things concerning Luna.
Now, what has the telescope told us regarding our moon?—It shows us
that there are mountains and craters, and numerous traces of volcanic action.
At one time it was supposed that the dark masses apparent in the surface
of the moon, and which can easily be distinguished by the naked eye, were
seas, and maps of the moon were made, marking continents and craters.</p>

<p>If it were possible to reach the moon, as M. Jules Verne’s travellers
did, we should find a very irregular and corrugated surface—plains and
mountains without water. We should be able to see the stars in the daytime,
because there is no atmosphere around the moon, and there is a silence
that “might be felt.” The appearance of our earth from the moon, and the
beauty of the stars in the unclouded and waterless space around the satellite,
must be very grand, and has been, in a measure, depicted in the illustration
(fig. 559) on the opposite page.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_511.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 560.—The Moon: the ring plain Copernicus.</div>
</div>

<p>In this illustration (fig. 560) we have some idea what the moon is like.
We see the rugged and cratered appearance of the disc; it is a desert waste,
so far as we can ascertain, without inhabitants, and, in all probability, without
vegetation. For there being no moisture amongst the plains and craters
and mountains of our satellite, we must conclude that the moon is dead.
It is a very interesting,—nay, a fascinating study. When we take up our
telescope and look from the window at the heavens the most beautiful object
within our small telescopic vision is the moon shining like a silver plate,
and we wonder what is up there. With a small telescope even we can discern
many interesting features in the moon at the full, which will assist us
in verifying the diagrams in books and their explanations.</p>

<p>As the moon is only a few miles away, comparatively speaking, and as
the large telescopes now in use bring us within a measurable distance of the
surface, we are enabled to speak more positively about our changeable
satellite than of any of the planets. When we look steadily at the full moon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
we perceive upon its surface dark and light tracts called “seas,” though
they are dried up now. Thus we
hear of the “Sea of Serenity,” the
“Sea of Storms,” and the “Sea of
Tranquillity”; and in the map upon
a subsequent page you may see the
names of the seas, mountains, and
the general formations of the surface
of the moon. Maps of the
moon are now to be procured,
though no personal visits can be
made to the satellite. It is very
interesting to observe or to read
about the structure of the moon,
for we may thus learn how similar
the earth and her attendant are in
formation; but one important agency—that
of water—has made a considerable
difference in the <em>appearance</em> of the formations. In the moon we
have mountains, plains, and rugged craters; the surface is not level, because
the sunlight is visible sooner at some points than others. The chief
mountain chain is the Apennines, and has a great elevation; many traces of
volcanic agency are discoverable amid the great desolation, and awful
silence reigns throughout.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_512a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 561.—Telescopic appearance of the Moon.</div>
</div>

<p>As is well known, water has a great erosive power, and its action disintegrates
the surface of the earth with rapid persistency. So the physical
appearance of the globe has become much changed in the course of ages:
ravines exist where plains used to extend, and rivers cut their way through
deep gorges to the sea. The sands and other deposits are overlaid, and thus
the whole outward appearance has been altered. Not so the moon. With a
very attenuated atmosphere without clouds or rain, there is no moisture,
no lake, no water in the moon now. What may have been we can only
conjecture. If there ever have been lakes or seas they have all been
absorbed.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_512b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 562.—Formations near Mostig. Low power.</div>
</div>

<p>The heat upon one side of the moon must be very great at one period,
and the cold on the opposite side intense, as one
would think—yet upon this fact authorities differ
somewhat. If the moon possess no atmosphere of
<em>any kind</em> it would be fearfully cold and extremely
hot at intervals, but a surrounding medium, even
of very little density, would modify the extremes;
and while we must accept the fact that the temperature
varies very much we need not place it above 100°
of heat, nor below 20° of cold. So from close observation
and comparison we are enabled to form a very fair opinion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
“past” of the moon, and to ascertain that the same forces of nature which
have moulded the planet we inhabit, have
been at work in the moon also. When we
study “Selenography,” therefore, we shall
find a record of a history which may some
day bear a parallel to the history of our
physical world.</p>

<p>The moon, as all are aware, moves round
the earth attendant upon us, but entirely
under the control of the sun; our satellite,
moreover, has been the subject of many superstitions. A great many rites
and even domestic actions—such as the killing of fowls—were regulated by
the moon; and in Scotland, Scandinavia, and other portions of Europe,
she has always been regarded as effecting destiny. There are many
interesting myths connected with the moon, and indeed with astronomy
generally, and from a volume entitled “Notes on Unnatural History,” some
very amusing extracts might be made. It will not be out of place to
mention a few of these myths.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_513b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 564.—The walled-plain Plato.</div>
</div>

<p>The Chinese have an idea that a rabbit exists in the moon, and is the
cause of the shadows we see. The Buddhists think a holy hare is up there.
In the Pacific Islands there is a belief of a woman in the moon; she was
sent there because she wished her child to have a bit of it to eat; and Mr.
Buchanan has versified the old Scandinavian myth about the two children
kidnapped by the moon as they returned from a well with a bucket of water
slung upon a pole. The Jews placed Jacob in the moon, and the Italians
say that Cain inhabits the luminary with a dog and a thorn bush. In the
<cite>Inferno</cite> of Dante this is referred to, and we know that in <cite>A Midsummer
Night’s Dream</cite> we have the moon coming out to shine upon the loves of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
Pyramus and Thisbe with the dog and the thorn-bush; and in the <cite>Tempest</cite>
the same idea is mentioned by Caliban. Readers of Longfellow will recall
the lines how “the good Nokomis answered” Hiawatha, who asked about
the moon—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Once a warrior, very angry,</div>
<div class="verse">Seized his grandmother, and threw her</div>
<div class="verse">Up into the sky at midnight.</div>
<div class="verse">Right against the moon he threw her,</div>
<div class="verse">‘Tis her body that you see there.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But modern scientific research has exploded all these charming old myths,
and laid bare the facts for us. We must now resume.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_514small.jpg" alt="The link Moon leads to a list of the formations" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 565.—Map of Moon showing <a href="#Moon_Features">principal formations</a>.</div>
</div>


<p>The moon moves around us in 27<sup>d</sup> 7<sup>h</sup> 43<sup>m</sup> 11·461<sup>s</sup>. Its diameter is
about 2,160 miles, and it is much less dense than our earth, and so the force
of gravity is less there than here. Its mean distance from us is 238,833
miles. The moon goes through certain changes or phases every twenty-nine
days or so; and while rotating on its own axis our satellite goes round the
earth, so that we only see one side of the moon, inasmuch as the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
motions occupy almost exactly the same space of time. So we generally
see the same space of the moon, though there is a slight variation at times.
This movement or swaying of the central point is called the moon’s “libration,”
and is an optical effect, due to the inequalities in the motion of the
moon in its orbit, and to the inclination of its equator and orbit to the
ecliptic.</p>

<p>We append a map of the moon, on which the mountains, seas, and
craters can be perceived, according to the list. The hill ranges extend for
hundreds of miles, and the elevation reaches 30,000 feet, and even more in
places. The so-called craters do not resemble volcanoes when viewed closely,
but take the form of basins or valleys surrounded by lofty hills. One great
plain called Copernicus is more than fifty miles across. Respecting the
appearance of the moon let us quote Mr. Lockyer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_515.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 566.—The Apennines and walled plain Archimedes.</div>
</div>

<p>“Fancy a world without water, and therefore without ice, cloud, rain,
snow; without rivers or streams, and therefore without vegetation to support
animal life;—a world without twilight or any gradations between the fiercest
sunshine and the blackest night; a world also without sound, for as sound
is carried by the air, the highest mountain on the airless moon might be
riven by an earthquake inaudibly.”</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phases of the Moon.</span></p>

<p>We have said that the moon revolves around the earth in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
time as she turns upon her own axis, and always presents one side to us
when she appears. Any one can ascertain this by putting a candle upon a
round table, and walk round it facing the candle. The experimentalist will
find that he will turn upon his own axis as well as turn around the table.
Thus we shall see how the moon changes, for to be as changeable as the
moon is proverbial. These different aspects or phases we shall now proceed
to explain.</p>

<p>The time intervening between one “new” moon and another is
29<sup>d</sup>, 12<sup>h</sup>, 44<sup>m</sup>, 2<sup>s</sup>, and is termed a synodic revolution. This is longer than the
sidereal revolution, because the earth is also moving in the same direction
and the moon has to make up the time the earth has got on in front, as it
were. So the moon travels nearly thirteen times round the earth while the
latter is going round the sun.</p>

<p>The revolutions of the moon have been a measurement of time for ages,
and her varying appearances during lunation are always observed with
interest. The illustration (fig. 567) will assist us materially. The sun’s rays
fall in a parallel direction upon the earth and moon, and let us suppose
that <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> is the sun in the diagram and <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span> the earth; <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> at the various points is
the moon, the capital letters, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, etc., indicating the planet as she appears
from the sun, and the small letters show how she appears to us from the
earth.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the sun, earth, and moon are in conjunction—or in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
a direct line. The phases, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">G</span>, are the moon’s “quadratures.” At <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>
we see the sun shining on the moon, but we only have the dark side. It is
then “new” moon; but by degrees, as she goes
round in her orbit, we perceive a small crescent-shaped
portion, lighted up by the sun at <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> and
<i>b</i>. At <i>c´</i> we have the first quarter or half-moon.
When she is in opposition she is at full moon, and
so on to the last quarter and conjunction again.</p>

<p>The moon’s phases may be easily shown by
means of a medium-sized lamp to represent the
earth, a smaller one to serve as moon, and a light
to act as sun all at the same height. Colour the
“lunar” globe white, and if we move it about
the “earth” globe, we shall see the various phases
of the moon in the sharp shadows.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Tides.</span></p>

<p>The ebb and flow of our tidal waters depend upon the moon to a great
extent. The phenomenon is so common, that we need only refer to it, but
the cause of the tides may be stated. Twice every day we have the tides twelve
hours apart, and the flow and ebb are
merely examples of the attraction of gravitation,
which is exercised upon all bodies,
either liquid or solid. The tides are highest
at the equator and lowest at the poles,
because the tropics are more exposed to
the influence of the lunar attraction.</p>

<div class="figleft" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 569.—Moon’s attraction.</div>
</div>

<p>By the small diagram (fig. 569) we shall be able to see in a moment how
the moon acts. The moon being nearer to the earth at <i>b</i>, the water will be
naturally attracted to the ball, <i>m</i>, and cause high water (<i>a</i>); and a similar
effect will be produced opposite, because the
earth is attracted, so the waves are higher
than the ground which has been attracted
away from the water, and the waters will flow
in and cause a high tide at <i>d</i>, but not <i>so</i> high
a tide as at the opposite point, <i>a</i>. It can
then be understood that there will be low
water at the other two sides, <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>,
because the water has been taken away, so
to speak, for the high tides at <i>a</i> and <i>d</i>. We
shall learn more of this under Physical
Geography.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 570.—New Moon.</div>
</div>

<p>The moon revolves round the earth in
a changeable elliptical orbit, intersecting the ecliptic at certain points called
<em>Nodes</em>. When the moon is nearest to the Earth she is said to be in <em>perigee</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
when farthest from us she is in <em>apogee</em> (the line uniting these points is the
line of <em>apsides</em>), the difference in distance being about 4,000 miles. She
passes the sun periodically, and so if the moon moved in the plane of the
ecliptic there would be eclipses of the sun and moon twice a month; but as
the orbit is inclined a little, she escapes by moving north or south. We
will now endeavour to explain this theory.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Eclipses.</span></p>

<p>We have briefly considered the <span class="smcap">Sun</span> and <span class="smcap">Earth</span> and the <span class="smcap">Moon</span>
separately. We are now about to regard the effects produced by them
when they come in each other’s way and cause <span class="smcap">Eclipses</span>, which are observed
with so much interest. There are eclipses of the sun and of the moon.
The former occur at the time of new moon, and the latter at full moon;
and this will be at once understood when we remember that the sun is
eclipsed by the moon passing between us and the sun; and the moon is
eclipsed because the <em>shadow of the earth</em>
falls upon her when she is <em>opposite</em> the
sun, and therefore “full.”</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_518a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 571.—Solar eclipse with corona.</div>
</div>

<p>Readers of the voyages of Columbus
will remember that he managed to obtain
supplies from negatively hostile Jamaica
savages by pretending to cause an eclipse
of the moon, which he knew was about to
take place, and to the ancients eclipses were
of dire portent. Even in enlightened
Rome, to ascribe an eclipse to the causes
of nature was a crime. The Chinese have
an idea that great dragons are devouring
the moon when she is eclipsed.</p>

<p>There are total, partial, and annular eclipses. The former terms speak
for themselves; the latter name is derived from “annulus,” a ring; for a ring
of light is left around the dark portion eclipsed, and is only seen in solar
eclipses. In one sense the eclipse of the sun is really an eclipse of the earth,
because it is caused by the shadow of the moon falling upon the earth.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_518b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 572.—Umbra and penumbra.</div>
</div>

<p>If a bright body, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, be larger than the dark body, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>,
there will be two kinds of shadows—viz., the <em>umbra</em> and the
<em>penumbra</em>. For instance, the umbra is the central dark part
in the cut (fig. 572), and the penumbra is the lighter portion.
As soon as the eye is placed on the umbra, it can perceive
no part of the source of light, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, which appears to be eclipsed.
On the other hand, the <em>penumbra</em> originates in that locality
where only a portion of the light proceeding from a luminous
object can fall; hence an eye in the <em>penumbra</em> would see a part, but not the
whole of the illuminating body. This shadow also forms a cone, the apex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
of which, if extended, will fall before the opaque body. If we receive the
shadows so projected at <i>m</i> <i>n</i>, for example, on a white sheet, we have in the
centre a dark circle, which is the umbra, surrounded by the penumbra,
which gradually decreases in intensity towards the exterior (<i>see</i> fig. 573).
The farther we hold the sheet from the body producing the shadow, the
umbra decreases, and the penumbra is enlarged. For where (in solar eclipses)
the <em>umbra</em> falls there is totality; within the penumbra partial eclipse only.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_519a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 573.—Lunar eclipse.</div>
</div>

<p><em>Lunar Eclipse.</em>—Let <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> (fig. 573) be the sun, and <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> the earth, the length
of the umbra of the latter will
exceed 108 diameters of the
earth. Since the moon is only
about thirty terrestrial diameters
distant from the earth, and as
the diameter of the earth’s
shadow, at this distance, is nearly
three times as large as the apparent
diameter of the moon, it
follows that when the latter enters this shadow, she must be totally eclipsed,
for at those places where the moon’s shadow falls there is total eclipse. If
the moon’s orbit were coincident with the ecliptic, or if both moon and earth
moved round the sun in the same plane, there would be an eclipse at every
conjunction, and at every opposition,—<i>i.e.</i>, a solar eclipse would happen at
every new moon, and a lunar eclipse at every full moon. But we have seen
that the lunar orbit cuts the ecliptic only in two points; consequently an
eclipse of the moon is possible only when, at the
time of opposition, the moon is in one of her nodes,
or in close proximity to it, which can only occur
twenty-nine times in the space of eighteen years.</p>

<p>A lunar eclipse begins on the eastern margin
of the moon, and is either <em>total</em>, when her whole disc
enters the umbra, or <em>partial</em>, when only part of her
disc is in the shadow. A total eclipse may last for
two hours.</p>

<p>We shall understand this better, perhaps, with
the diagrams.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_519b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 574.—Solar eclipse.</div>
</div>

<p><em>Solar Eclipses.</em>—When the moon and the sun are
in conjunction, the moon’s place may be represented by
<span class="smcap lowercase">M</span> (fig. 574) between the earth, <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>, and the sun, <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>. If
this conjunction occur when the moon is in one of her
nodes, or within 16° of it, the shadow of the moon will
fall upon the earth, and the sun will be eclipsed. At
other places the sun will not be entirely covered; and
if the moon be moved farther off, so that its shadow
will not reach the earth, and so not cover the sun up completely, we shall
have an annular eclipse, because a rim of the sun will be visible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span></p>

<p>The lunar umbra extends from the moon by a space about equal to her
distance from the earth, and hence only a small portion, <i>d</i>, of the earth’s
surface enters the lunar umbra. To the inhabitants of this part of the earth
the sun will be totally eclipsed, and the eclipse will be annular if only the
margin of the sun’s disc remain uneclipsed by the lunar shadow. This is only
possible when the moon is in her apogee, or greatest distance from the earth,
where her apparent diameter is less than that of the sun, which it cannot in
general exceed more than 1´ 38″. Hence the duration of a total eclipse
of the sun cannot be more than 3&frac14; minutes.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the penumbra of the moon is diffused over a much
larger portion, <i>n</i> <i>m</i>, of the surface of the earth, since its section is five-ninths
of the earth’s diameter. The inhabitants of this portion of the earth do not
receive light from all parts of the sun, consequently a <em>part</em> of this luminary
is invisible to them, and the eclipse is said to be <em>partial</em>.</p>

<p>Solar eclipses commence on the western margin of the sun, and advance
to the eastern. On account of the proximity of the moon to us, an eclipse
of the sun is, in all places above the horizon of which the sun appears,
visible neither at the same time, nor is it of equal duration, nor of equal
extent: in some parts it may not be visible at all. In favourable situations,
the diameter of the umbra, where it reaches the earth, amounts to about 167
miles, and on this small strip of the earth’s surface only can the sun appear
totally eclipsed.</p>

<small>THE PLANETS AND ASTEROIDS.</small></h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mercury.</span></p>

<p>Including our own globe there are eight principal planets—viz., Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The two first-named
being between us and the sun, are termed <em>interior</em> planets; the others are
<em>exterior</em>. Mercury, Venus, and Mars are smaller than Earth. The other four
are much larger.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_521.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 576.—An Orrery.</div>
</div>

<p>We have already described the planets as bodies wandering through
the zodiac, and reflecting the sun’s light. Their orbits are very different
from the moon’s; for instance, planets take a retrograde motion as well as
a direct one. The sun and the planets revolving around him constitute the
solar system.</p>

<p>We will commence our brief consideration of them with Mercury, the
planet nearest to the sun.</p>

<p>The distance of Mercury from the sun is 35,000,000 of miles, less than
half the distance our earth is from him, and so receives much more heat and
light than we do. The sun to the Mercurians, if there be any inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
upon the planet, must appear about seven times larger than he does to us.
Mercury’s year is about eighty-five days in length, so the seasons must be
shorter if they follow the same rotation as ours. It passes through space
with an exceedingly rapid motion, and so probably the ancients called the
swift planet Mercury after the winged messenger of Jove.</p>

<p>Mercury is not an easy planet to observe, owing to its proximity to
the sun, yet the ancients managed to descry it. But it can be seen just
before sunrise and sunset in autumn, and in spring if the weather be clear.
It possesses phases similar to our moon. Some authorities have stated that
Mercury has an atmosphere, but this circumstance, as well as its formation,
is still shrouded in mystery. Mercury’s day is a few minutes longer than
ours.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_522a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 577.—Transit of Mercury.</div>
</div>

<p>A transit of Mercury is represented in the accompanying illustration
(fig. 577). This phenomenon took place in 1845, but there have been many
others noticed. The first recorded took place in November 1631, and these
transits always occur in May or November.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Venus.</span></p>

<p>Venus is the planet next in order, and revolves about 66,000,000 of
miles from the sun. It is the nearest planet to the earth, and is somewhat
smaller than the latter. This planet
is both a morning and evening star,
and is very brilliant—so much so, that
any close observation with the telescope
is not possible; and when at
her nearest point she is invisible as
she passes between us and the sun,
and of course when fully illuminated she is directly beyond the sun, and
enclosed in his rays. But under other circumstances she is distinctly visible
as a crescent in the evening, and nearly full as a morning star. Venus
goes round the sun in 224 days, and her day is rather less than ours.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_522b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 578.—Orbit of Venus.</div>
</div>

<p>Venus has long been celebrated as the morning and evening star, as
“Lucifer” and “Hesperus.” “Lucifer, son of the morning,” is mentioned
by Isaiah. That Venus possesses an atmosphere denser than our own can
scarcely be doubted. The observations made during the successive transits,
particularly the last (1874), seem to have established the fact that aqueous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
vapour exists around, and water in, Venus. No satellite can be found, though
the ancients reported such an attendant upon this planet.</p>

<p>The apparent diameter of Venus varies considerably in consequence of
her varying distances at the inferior and superior
conjunction. When nearest the earth, if she presented
her fully illuminated disc to our gaze, we
should see a miniature moon, and even under the
circumstances Venus throws a shadow, so brilliant
is her light.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_523a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 579.—Venus, at quadrature.</div>
</div>

<p>The transits of Venus have been referred to,
and, like those of Mercury, are simply a passing,
or “transit,” of the planet across the illuminated
disc of the sun. The transits afford means to
ascertain the volume and distance, etc., of the sun, and this year (1882) the
next transit is expected. There will not be another for more than one
hundred years.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_523b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 580.—Venus, near inferior conjunction.</div>
</div>

<p>Whether Venus has a constitution similar to our globe is of course
doubtful. The matter is less dense than the earth,
and there is an atmosphere half as dense again as
ours. Spots have been noticed crossing the
planet, which may have been vapours or clouds,
and the rotation of Venus on its axis was calculated
from these spots as being 23<sup>h</sup> 21<sup>m</sup> 22<sup>s</sup>.
The seasons in Venus must be very different from
ours, as her inclination is greater than our earth,
and as the sun is so much nearer to her than to
us her tropical and polar regions are close, and
a vertical sun is scarcely enjoyed by two places
for three successive days, and she may have two
winters and summers, two springs and autumns!</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mars.</span></p>

<p>Having already considered the earth, we pass on from Venus to Mars.
The orbit of the latter planet is exterior to the earth’s, as is proved by his
never appearing “horned,” nor ever passing across the sun’s disc. Therefore
no “transits” of Mars can take place as transits of Venus and Mercury.</p>

<p>Yet Mars is most favourably situated for astronomical observation by
us, because it turns its full disc to us. Venus is nearer to us than Mars—but,
as we have explained, when she comes nearest to us she is quite invisible.
Astronomers have been enabled to ascertain a good deal concerning the
planet of war—“the red planet Mars.”</p>

<p>Mars has been considered very like the earth. We perceive seas and
continents, and the shape of Mars is like the earth. But our globe is larger
than Mars, which is much less dense, so the force of gravitation is less also.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
Mars moves upon his axis in about twenty-four hours and a half, and takes
rather more than 686 days to revolve round the sun. (<i>See</i> page 489.) Thus
its days are a little longer than, and its
years twice as long as our days and
years. When in “opposition,” or on
the opposite side of us from the sun,
Mars is at his brightest. This happened
in September 1877. He will come close
again to us in 1892.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_524a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 581.—Mars seen from the earth.</div>
</div>

<p>All planets are wanderers, but of
all the wanderers Mars has the most
eccentric orbit. He curls about, so to
speak, in loops and curves in a very
irregular manner, and therefore his distance
from the earth varies very considerably;
and this eccentric behaviour
of the warlike planet must have, as we believe it did, puzzled the ancients
very much. But—and here reason came to human aid—this very fact, this
great eccentricity of the planetary motions, caused Copernicus to investigate
the subject with great attention, and he at length explained the true reason
of these irregular orbits from the hypothesis that it was around the sun, and
not around the earth that the planets moved in regular orbits.</p>

<p>It is quite ascertained that Mars is very like our earth in miniature.
We annex a diagram of the planet, and when it is examined with a good
telescope the seas and continents can be quite distinctly perceived. At the
poles there appears to be a white or snowy region at varying periods, which
would lead us to the conclusion that the atmospheric changes and the seasons
are similar to our own; and as the inclination of the planet is nearly the
same as the earth, this supposition may be accepted as a fact.</p>

<p>Thus we see that Mars is the most like
earth of all the planets, and its inhabitants—if,
indeed, it is now inhabited—must have a
beautiful view of us when the weather is fine,
for we are so much larger. Mars is also attended
by two satellites, or moons, as Professor
Hall reported from Washington in
1877. These moons have been named
<em>Deimos</em> and <em>Phobos</em>, and are both very small,
their diameter being only about six miles;
but late astronomers have reasoned that they
must be three times this diameter.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_524b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 582.—Earth seen from Mars.</div>
</div>

<p>There have been numerous theories
concerning Mars being inhabited, and of
course these suggestions made respecting life on one planet may, with
varying circumstances, be applied to another. Each planet may have had,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
or may yet have, to pass through what has been termed a “life-bearing
stage.” We on earth are at present in the enjoyment of that stage. So far
as we can tell, therefore, Mars may be inhabited now, as he bears much the
same appearance as our planet. Certain changes are going on in Mars, and
all planets, just as they go on here in our earth, and as they did long, long
ages before the earth was populated, and which will continue to go on after
life on the earth has ceased to exist.</p>

<p>Mars is, as we know, much further away from the sun than earth is,
and must receive less direct heat. When he was created, or formed, we can
only conjecture, but in all probability he cooled before the earth did, as he
is smaller. Here another theory concerning the state of Mars arises, and in
support of it we may quote an American authority upon the planet.</p>

<p>“His mass is not much more than one-ninth of the earth’s, while his
surface is about one-third of hers. Then, if originally formed of the same
temperature, he had only one-ninth her amount of heat to distribute. If
he had radiated it away at one-ninth of her rate, his supply would have
lasted as long, but radiation takes place from the surface in proportion to
the surface, hence he parted with it three times as fast as he should have
done to cool at the same rate as the earth, and must have attained a condition
which she will not attain until three times as long an interval has
elapsed from the era of her first existence than has already elapsed. Geologists
agree that the last-named period must be measured by many millions of
years; hence it follows that twice as many millions of years must elapse
before our earth will be in the same condition as Mars, and Mars must be
three times as far on the way toward planetary decrepitude and death as our
earth. Then assigning two hundred thousand years as the extreme duration
of the period during which men capable of studying the problems of the
universe have existed, and will exist on this earth, the theory holds that
Mars would have entered on that stage of his existence many millions
of years ago, and that the appearance of the planet itself implies a much
later stage of planetary existence.”</p>

<p>Mars is a very interesting study, and the reddish hue which is so distinctive
is perceived in certain spots when examined by the telescope’s aid.
These red places were discovered by Cassini. Mr. Dawes made drawings
of Mars, and Mr. Proctor has by their aid constructed a regular map of Mars,
and a chart of the surface of the planet. There is much more land than
water on Mars, as the bright surfaces which indicate land are much more
extensive than the darker portions which betoken the existence of water.
But these “markings” are not always visible, in consequence of something
coming between us and the land on Mars, and this has been attributed to
the production of vegetation, which a French <em>savant</em> declared was ruddy-coloured,
and that this autumnal tint departed in the winter.</p>

<p>The seasons of Mars are not equal, in consequence of his wandering
propensities, and winter is warmer up there than our winter, while summer
is cooler than our summer. That there are clouds and an aqueous atmo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>sphere
surrounding Mars we learn from spectroscopic observation and
analysis, and in fine we may look upon Mars as similar to our earth.
Respecting the question of its habitation we take the liberty to quote
Mr. Richard Proctor:—</p>

<p>“I fear my own conclusion about Mars is that his present condition is
very desolate. I look on the ruddiness of tint to which I have referred as
one of the signs that the planet of war has long since passed its prime.
There are lands and seas in Mars, the vapour of water is present in his air,
clouds form, rains and snows fall upon his surface, and doubtless brooks and
rivers irrigate his soil, and carry down the moisture collected on his wide
continents to the seas whence the clouds had originally been formed. But
I do not think there is much vegetation on Mars, or that many living
creatures of the higher types of Martian life as it once existed still remain.
All that is known about the planet tends to show that the time when it
attained that stage of planetary existence through which our earth is now
passing must be set millions of years, perhaps hundreds of millions of years
ago. He has not yet, indeed, reached that airless and waterless condition, that
extremity of internal cold, or in fact that utter unfitness to support any kind
of life, which would seem to prevail in the moon. The planet of war in
some respects resembles a desolate battle-field, and I fancy that there is not
a single region of the earth now inhabited by man which is not infinitely
more comfortable as an abode of life than the most favoured regions of Mars
at the present time would be for creatures like ourselves.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Moons of Mars.</span></p>

<p>We must devote a few lines to the satellites of Mars, which during the
last four years have proved a very interesting study for the astronomers,
and some very interesting facts have been ascertained concerning the ruddy
planet, which is now proved not to be “moonless Mars,” as the poet declared.</p>

<p>There are two satellites, which, in consequence of their distance from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
him, being so different, vary in apparent size. The outer one is twelve
thousand, the inner one about three thousand five hundred miles from the
planet, so the former would revolve in about thirty hours in a direction from
west to east, and the inner moon goes round in the same way in about seven
hours and a half. Mars revolves in twenty-four and a half hours from west
to east. So the outer moon rises for him in the east, and the inner one in
the west. This is accounted for by the fact that one travelling slower than
Mars rises in the east, the other outruns him, and comes up in the west.</p>

<p>But if we suppose ourselves upon Mars we shall find that, after all, we
have only one moon properly so called. The outer satellite is very small
and very far away, so it is useless to give light—at most, it is no bigger
than Mars appears to us on earth. So the Martians do not see two moons
passing each other in the sky—that is, unless their eyes are of greater range
and power than ours. Thus they have one moon rising in the west, appearing
in all its phases <em>every night</em>, while our moon takes twenty-eight days to pass
through her phases; for we must remember that Mars’ moon takes only
seven hours and forty minutes to pass through its orbit, and therefore each
quarter will not occupy quite two hours.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Minor Planets, or Asteroids.</span></p>

<p>Passing onward from Mars towards Jupiter we arrive at a number of
smaller planets, which will not concern us very much, as they are very small
and scarcely visible without a good telescope. But a very interesting chapter
in the history of astronomy was commenced when the discovery of these
bodies was begun. In old times astronomers noticed a very considerable
gap between Mars and Jupiter, which was remarkable when the regular
progression of the distances between the planets was remembered. So Kepler
was of opinion that some planet would be discovered having its orbit in that
space between Mars and Jupiter. It is, however, to Piazzi, the Italian, that
the discovery of the zone of asteroids is due.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 584.—Field of view showing motion of minor planets amongst the stars.</div>
</div>

<p>Piazzi was surveying the constellation Taurus, where he fancied he had
discovered a change of place in a star which he had observed on the 1st of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
January in that year (1801). He was quite sure of this change next day
(the 3rd of January), and he expressed his opinion to Bode and Oriani.
But letters took a long time to pass in those days, and when the other
astronomers had received the advices the new star had been lost in the sun’s
glory. But after a year, on the 31st December, 1801, the planet was again
seen and the discovery was proved. The new planet was named <span class="smcap">Ceres</span>.</p>

<p>The discovery of Ceres led to other discoveries. For, while searching
for her, Olbers found other minor planets, and so on to the present day.
Now we have nearly two hundred asteroids, and more are probably to be
found in the zone beyond Mars.</p>

<p>It would answer no purpose to give a list of the asteroids. We need
only remark that the first four were discovered in quick succession, and then
a lapse of thirty-eight years occurred before the fifth was found, thus—</p>

<p>Since 1848 there have been numerous minor planets discovered every
year.</p>

<p>The hypothesis that all these asteroids are fragments of one large planet
which has been destroyed was started by
Olbers; and in confirmation of this view it has
been determined that the asteroids have essentially
the same character. The orbits of these
minor planets are different from the larger
“wanderers,” and cross each other, as will be
seen from the accompanying diagram, so that
a collision may one day ensue.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_528.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 585.—Orbit of asteroids.</div>
</div>

<p>Planetoids and extra zodiacal planets are
titles which have been bestowed upon these
bodies, of which <span class="smcap">Vesta</span> is the first in order in
the system, and revolves in 1,325 days, at a
mean distance of 225,000,000 of miles from the
sun. <span class="smcap">Juno</span> and <span class="smcap">Ceres</span> take each about four of our years to revolve in their
orbits, at greater distances still, averaging 260,000,000 of miles. Pallas and
Ceres are most alike in their periods and distance from the sun; the principal
asteroids are only about 300 miles in diameter, while the smaller are
very tiny indeed, and one certainly has quite disappeared.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jupiter, the Giant.</span></p>

<p>Jupiter has been well named the Giant planet, since his diameter is
eleven times greater, and he is thirteen hundred times larger than our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
planet. His inclination is very small, and you now know that under such
circumstances he enjoys very small changes of seasons. Jupiter has four
moons, or satellites, and an illustration of the “Jovian System” is herewith
given.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption">Fig. 586.—The Jovian System.</div>
</div>

<p>Jupiter himself was well known to the ancients, but Galileo was the
discoverer of the “moons.” His telescope was, of course, a very imperfect
instrument, and while he was gazing at the planet he noticed three stars
close by the bright disc, two on one side, but next day Galileo perceived
them all at the same side. Next time he looked there were only two, and
after many anxious observations he found out, not only that Jupiter had three
attendant stars, but four!</p>

<p>These moons were found to revolve round Jupiter in times varying from
nearly two days to nearly sixteen days, according as they were at a less or
greater distance from him. They were found to have their times of eclipses
and transits, etc., also. These moons act with respect to Jupiter very much
as the inner planets act with respect to the sun, for observation showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
Galileo that the satellites sometimes appeared on one side of the planet, and
at other times on the opposite side.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_530a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 587.—Satellite in Transit.</div>
</div>

<p>From the diagram of the Jovian System we shall understand the orbits of
the moons, which are all of nearly equal size,—two
thousand miles in diameter,—and cause eclipses of the
sun to Jupiter. If the earth be in the same direction
as the sun the moons are lost to view. The satellites
disappear into the shadow, and are eclipsed at
1′″, 2′″, 3′″, 4′″, respectively, but they do not always
come into view again immediately they have passed
through the planet’s shadow, because the earth is a
little at one side of the sun. So when the satellite
gets behind the edge of Jupiter, his shadow being on
the opposite side to the satellite’s, it is said that the
“moon” is in “occultation”; when it disappears in the shadow it is “eclipsed.”
Cassini discovered the “transit” of Jupiter’s moons. The annexed diagram
illustrates the eclipses, etc., very clearly. At the four points, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>, we have
the earth; <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span> is Jupiter with his moons; 1 2 3 4 is their orbits. At <i>a</i> moon
No. 1 enters his shadow, and emerges at <i>b</i>. From the earth at <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span> <i>a</i> will be
visible, but not <i>b</i>, because Jupiter is in the way. So at <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, the coming out,
or <em>emersion</em>, will be visible, but not the entrance into the shadow, or <em>immersion</em>.
At <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> the satellite is in transit <i>d</i>, on the disc of the planet, <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span>.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_530b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 588.—Eclipses of Jupiter’s Moons.</div>
</div>

<p>From the observation of the eclipses of Jupiter’s moons the rate of the
transmission of light was discovered by Roëmer in 1675, and its progressive
motion was calculated. The eclipses were noticed to take place later than
the calculated time, when the planet was approaching conjunction. Roëmer
suggested that the delay was owing to the greater distance the light had
to travel—a distance equal to the diameter of the earth’s orbit, or about
190,000,000 of miles. The time was about sixteen minutes. Light was
found to travel at the rate of nearly 12,000,000 of miles a minute.</p>

<p>Let us now endeavour to picture Jupiter himself. Here we have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
illustration of the planet. He is the biggest, and the brightest, except Venus,
of all the planets. He revolves at a distance
of 476,000,000 of miles from the sun,
and his year is equal to nearly twelve of
ours, while his day is scarcely ten hours long,
showing a rapidity more than twenty times
the rate of our earth. Jupiter, therefore, must
have a very much greater diameter than the
earth.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_531a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 589.—Jupiter.</div>
</div>

<p>There is much less sunlight and heat
found on Jupiter than upon Earth, because he
is so much farther from the sun than we are,
but at the same time the heat comes at less
intervals than with us. And here the theory
already noticed respecting the gradual cooling
of the planets will be remembered. Jupiter,
we can easily imagine, would take much
longer to get cool than Mars or the earth,
and, though his rapid rotation would assist
him, he must be still in the midst of a glowing
atmosphere without form and void—perhaps a furnace for cloud and
vapour generation.</p>

<p>Now when Jupiter is examined with the telescope it will be seen that
he is crossed by belts of vapour (<i>see</i> also page 489); and when we consider
the results of the spectrum analysis of the planet, we may fairly assume that
Jupiter is in a very heated state, and that we cannot really perceive the
actual body of the planet at all yet. There is an immense quantity of
water thus surrounding Jupiter, and he is still in the condition in which our
earth was before geology grasps its state, and long ere vegetation or life
appeared. The waters have yet to be “gathered together into one place,”
and the dry land has yet to appear upon Jupiter, who is a very juvenile, if a
very enormous planet. Under these conditions we can safely assume that
there are no inhabitants of Jupiter.</p>

<p>The belts, or zones, of Jupiter vary in hue, and the continual changes
which are taking place in this cloud region tend to show that disturbances
of great magnitude and importance are occurring.</p>

<p>It is useless to speculate upon what will happen in Jupiter when the
disc is eventually cooled. The planet, we know, has not nearly reached
maturity; the earth is in the full prime of its life, and the moon is dead and
deserted. What the millions of years which must elapse before Jupiter has
cooled may bring forth we need not try to find out. The earth will then, in
all probability, be as dreary as the moon is now, and we shall have returned
to dust.</p>

<p>We now come to the most curious of all the planets—Saturn, which
is an immense globe surrounded by a beautiful bright ring, or rather series
of rings, and attended by eight
moons. He appears to possess
much the same constitution as
Jupiter, but enveloped in an even
denser atmosphere than the latter.
Saturn’s diameter is about nine
times greater than the earth; he
revolves on an inclined axis in
about ten hours, and has seasonal
alternations of unequal length. His year is about thirty of ours (10,759
days). The most striking phenomena in connection with Saturn are his
<em>rings</em>.</p>

<p>Saturn’s rings are supposed to be a close agglomeration of stars, or
satellites, revolving around the planet and encircling him in a belt. The
rings are apparently broad and flat and thin, resembling roughly the horizon
of a globe.</p>

<p>The globe of the planet is not exactly in the centre of the rings, which
have been measured, and are approximately as below:—</p>

<p>The rings were first recognised as such by Huyghens in 1659, but
Galileo had remarked the curious appearance the planet presented. Cassini
confirmed Huyghens’ discovery, and found that the ring was duplicated, and
Mr. Ball made the same discovery.
The two outermost rings are very
bright, the inner ring being darker
and partially transparent, for the
ball of Saturn can be perceived
through it.</p>

<p>But the rings are not always
so plainly seen as in the foregoing
diagram. Sometimes they appear
as a mere line of light on each side of the planet, as shown in the margin.
This occurs at the time of the equinox (fig. 591). By degrees, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
as they become inclined, they appear broader (fig. 592). The inner ring
may be formed of vapour, but the outer
ones are of something more solid, as
the shadows they cast upon the planet,
and it casts upon them, at certain
times (figs. 593 and 594).</p>

<p>Saturn possesses eight moons,
seven of them revolving in orbits on
the plane of the rings, but one is more
inclined. These eight satellites have
been named as follows:—</p>

<p>But these eight moons are not so interesting as those belonging to
Jupiter, because the great distance they
are away precludes much examination
of them. They vary much in size, Titan
being the largest, and perhaps equal to
Mars, Iapetus being next in magnitude.
The light of these satellites and the
rings is no doubt very great in the aggregate,
and must have a magnificent
appearance in the heavens (compare
page 493). Very likely there are other
attendants upon Saturn, but owing to
the brilliancy of the rings it is impossible to distinguish them.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Uranus.</span></p>

<p>Uranus was discovered by Herschel in 1781, and has been called after
its discoverer, and sometimes the “Georgium Sidus.” It revolves at an
enormous distance from the sun—viz., 1,753,000,000 of miles. It takes
about eighty-four of our years (30,686 days) to go round the sun, and
possesses four moons. It is very much larger than the earth—about four
times the diameter, and forty times its volume. We can only speculate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
concerning its physical constitution, which is assumed to be similar to that
of Jupiter, while the changes of temperature and seasons must vary immensely.
The names of the moons are Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon.
The outer pair can be seen without much difficulty.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Neptune.</span></p>

<p>The existence of this planet was determined by calculation before it had
been seen at all. Uranus was observed to be disturbed in his orbit, moving
sometimes faster than at others; and even before
Uranus had been discovered Saturn and
Jupiter had been seen to be affected by some
body in the system. M. Leverrier determined
to ascertain the cause of this, and came to
the conclusion that some other planet was influencing
Uranus. The Newtonian theory here
received a most convincing proof. While
Leverrier was calculating, Mr Adams of Cambridge
leaped to the same conclusion, and wrote
the result of his calculations to Professor Airy,
and the planet was seen, but not reported upon.
Meantime Leverrier published his calculations,
and the observers at Berlin detected the new planet in September 1846.</p>

<p>Very little can be said concerning Neptune, as its distance is too great
for observation. It is at 2,746,000,000 of miles from the sun, and takes
164 years to go round it (60,126 days). It is about the same size as
Uranus. It has one moon, which moves round the planet in 5<sup>d</sup> 21<sup>h</sup>, and is
of great size.</p>

<p class="hang">FIXED STARS—MAGNITUDE OF THE STARS—CONSTELLATIONS—DESCRIPTIONS
OF THE ZODIACAL CONSTELLATIONS—NORTHERN AND
SOUTHERN STAR GROUPS—DISTANCE OF STARS.</p>


<p>We have been considering the planets so far as they are known to
astronomers, but no doubt we shall find out others some day beyond
Neptune in space, for it must be assumed that there are other planets
wandering about in the infinite firmament. At present, however, we cannot
spare time for such speculation; we have got to peep at the stars and
their groupings.</p>

<p>“What little bits of things the stars are,” a child said once in our hearing;
and there were others present who were inclined to believe that the
tiny light spots we could see looked small—not because they were distant,
but because they were of no great magnitude; and when those children
were told that the tiny stars were “suns” like our sun, giving heat and light
millions and millions of miles away,—and, so far as we can tell, some are
much bigger and hotter than our own sun,—they were very much surprised
indeed, and one little girl aptly quoted Dr. Watts:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Twinkle, twinkle, little star,</div>
<div class="verse">How I wonder what you are”!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now let us endeavour to learn something about these apparently tiny specks,
and why they “twinkle.”</p>

<p>At a very early period in the history of astronomy the observers of the
heavens grouped stars together in fancied resemblances to men or animals;
and these “constellations,” as they are termed, are combinations of <em>fixed
stars</em>—that is, of stars which do not wander about as the planets do. But
these so-called fixed stars have motions; they are only relatively fixed with
reference to their positions to each other as they appear to revolve daily
round the earth. But stars have a movement of their own, which is termed
their “proper motion.”</p>

<p>It is to Halley that the discovery of these real star motions is due. He
saw three very bright stars (Sirius, Aldebaran, and Arcturus) were not in
the places they had been assigned. The sun also has been found to possess
a “proper motion,” and, with the planets, is travelling as determined by Sir J.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
Herschel, to a particular place in the constellation called Hercules. There
are now star catalogues and star maps, for the heavens have been as closely
surveyed as the earth, and by accurate observations it has now become
possible to find the position of every star usually visible. Some of the stars
are used as “clock” stars, by which sidereal time can be calculated
accurately, and the clocks thereby corrected. The stars, though termed
“fixed,” are in perpetual movement—Arcturus at the rate of fifty miles a
second, and others less. Only the rates of a few are known.</p>

<p>The number of the stars is beyond our calculation, and even the
number of stars only visible in the telescope amount to millions, and these
are called telescopic stars. The visible stars amount to about six thousand,
and of course these are the brightest up to the sixth magnitude. There are
more visible in the southern than in the northern hemisphere. The magnitudes
of the stars range in classes according to the brightness of the stars
observed, for this is really the test from the first magnitude to the sixth; after
that the telescopic stars are seen up to the fifteenth or sixteenth. We
can only see about three thousand stars at any one time from any place,
although, as remarked above, many millions may be observed with a good
telescope, and as many more, probably twenty millions, are invisible.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to detail the constellations, which are familiar by
name to everybody. We have already given the names of the zodiacal
groups, which consist of many stars, each designated by a letter of the Greek
alphabet so far as possible, then the Roman letters and numerals are
employed. Thus α (Alpha) is the most brilliant star; β (Beta) the next
bright γ (Gamma) the next, and so on; so the relative brilliancy of the
stars in the constellation is indicated, but not the very biggest star of the
first magnitude is intended by α, for the star δ in one constellation may
equal α in another. John Bayer originated this method in 1603.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the constellations is plunged in the obscurity of
ages, but <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 370 there were forty-five thus grouped. There are northern
and southern constellations which are visible above our old friends Aries,
Taurus, Cancer, etc. We will, as in
duty bound, consider our old acquaintances
first, and then give a list of the northern
and southern groups of stars; but we
shall find that the forms are in the greater
part due to the imagination of the ancients,
and do not bear out our ideas of the animals
they are supposed to represent, while at the
same time they cross and recross with other
constellations in the skies in a very puzzling
way.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_536.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 596.—Aries.</div>
</div>


<p>The first constellation is <span class="smcap">Aries</span>, the
Ram, which is celebrated in mythology as
the proud possessor of the Golden Fleece, which we may remember was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
seized and carried away by Jason and the Argonauts. The Hellespont is
so called from Helle, who fell from the Ram’s back when being carried upon
it over the Black Sea. The Ram is here represented with the equinoctial ring.</p>

<p>We perceive in Aries two very bright stars near the head. These are
(α) Arietis and (γ) Sheretan. The signs and
constellations do not now correspond as they
used to do, because of the change in the
position of the stars, which gives rise to the
Precession of the Equinoxes (<i lang="la">vide ante.</i>, p.
497), so that the stars which two thousand
years ago were in conjunction with the sun,
are much more to the eastward. In olden
time (when astronomy was young), the sun
entered Aries on the 21st March, and now
a change has taken place. But in about
another twenty thousand years, they will all come right again. This will
be perceived by reference to the celestial globe. The Ram has sixty-six
stars in his constitution.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_537a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 597.—Taurus.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Taurus</span>, the Bull, is the next constellation. He received his name
from the celebrated animal into which Jupiter transformed himself when he
wished to carry away Europa. The star Aldebaran (α) is the end of a kind
of V in the Bull’s face. The Pleiades are on the shoulder to the right.
This cluster of twinkling stars is well known, and will guide the observer
towards the imaginary Bull, which we must nowadays describe as rather
a fanciful delineation. Europe is called after Europa, because Jupiter,
as a Bull, carried her to this continent. There are 141 stars in Taurus,
according to the number found in the list of Aratus, and probably more.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_537b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 598.—Gemini.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gemini</span>, the Twins, which are supposed to be Castor and Pollux, though
it is believed that two goats were the original
sign—which statement, taken in connection
with the ram and the bull, that were also
turned out in the spring-time, may have something
to recommend it. But now Castor and
Pollux are generally recognized as the constellation.
During the expedition for the
Golden Fleece, the electric appearance, now
known as St. Elmo’s Fire, became visible
upon them, and their effigies were placed in
the forepart of ships as a good omen. This
led to the adoption of the “figure-head.”
They were made into stars when Pollux was immortalized by Jupiter, for
he divided the boon with his brother. The planet Uranus was discovered
near this constellation, which contains eighty-five stars.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span></p>


<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_538a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 599.—Cancer.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Cancer</span>, the Crab, is the next in order, and the only derivation we can
find for this is that Juno sent a crab to attack
Hercules when he was busily engaged with
the many-headed Hydra. The crab was
directed to pinch the hero’s foot, but it appears
rather a lame device for the Queen to
adopt. The crab, however, was killed by
Hercules, and placed amongst the stars by
Juno as a reward; so he gained immortality
cheaply. He, Cancer, contains more than
eighty stars, but none of them of any particular
note. Some writers explain the sign
as reminding the ancients of “the retrograde movement of the sun to the
north”; but as a crab does not move “backwards,” we will still adhere to
mythology as equally satisfactory at any rate. Cancer, however, was termed
the “northern gate of the sun.”</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_538b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 600.—Leo.</div>
</div>

<p>The next is <span class="smcap">Leo</span>, the Lion, which came round in summer and at the
period of much heat, so this fierce animal
may have been chosen to represent that season.
But mythology will have us credit the
Nemæan Lion sent against Hercules by Juno
as the origin of this constellation. The lion
was, like the crab, placed amongst the stars
when he was killed. He is a very brilliant
constellation, and a very bright star called
Regulus is to be seen in his chest—“Cor
Leonis.” Another very fine star of the
second magnitude is observable in the tail.
The Lion consists of ninety-five stars, the
principal ones being of the first and second
magnitudes.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_538c.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 601.—Virgo.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Virgo</span> is supposed to be outlined by a
very rich cluster of stars, and one of the
first magnitude. The Virgin is by some
supposed to be Astræa, the goddess, but is
more likely referable to a girl gleaning, or
holding an ear of corn in semblance of
the harvest. This constellation contains
more than one hundred stars. One of them
in the wheat-ear is a particularly brilliant
one, and noted for its “solitary splendour,”
as no star of large magnitude is near it. The Arabs used to call it the
Solitary Simak; <i>Spica Virginis</i> is the modern name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span></p>


<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_539a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 602.—Libra.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Libra</span>, which follows, may either indicate the balance, or scales of
justice, of Astræa, or the equal day and
night at the autumnal equinox. Virgil mentions
Astræa’s balance, and thus we have a
classical authority for the very mythological
view of the two foregoing constellations.
Libra is not very distinct; it contains
fifty-one stars, four of which are very
bright.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_539b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 603.—Scorpio.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Scorpio</span>, the Scorpion, according to classical writers, encountered Orion,
who is also met with in the stellar universe.
The scorpion stung Orion because he declared
there was no living creature he could
not overcome by force. On the other hand,
this sign may have some reference to the
unhealthy time of year, and the prevalence
of disease about the time that <i>Scorpio</i> appeared.
A beautiful star of reddish hue
and of the first magnitude is prominent
amongst the brilliant assembly of the Scorpion’s forty-four stars.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_539c.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 604.—Sagittarius.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sagittarius</span>, the Archer, is, as one can see, a Centaur, and said to be
Chiron, who was wounded by Hercules, and
cured by being taken up to Heaven by
Jupiter. This Chiron is represented as a
great patron of the arts, and thus the fable
may be said to exemplify the proverb, “Art
is long, time is fleeting”; for readers of
mythology will find much more in the
legends than is apparent on the surface.
But we can now only regard the Centaur
from an astronomical,
and not a
philosophical
standpoint.
Sagittarius has no very brilliant stars. He is
close to the Milky Way, and contains sixty-nine
stars, five forming a sort of V in the bow,
sometimes compared to a ladle or “dipper.”</p>


<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_539d.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 605.—Capricornus.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Capricornus</span>, the Goat, is supposed to
be <i>Pan</i>—“the great god Pan,” who turned
himself into a goat. The sun was in Capricornus
at mid-winter, so the “southern gate of the sun” was a title be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>stowed
upon him. But now the constellation is later. It does not include
any very striking stars, of which there are fifty-one in the “Goat.”</p>


<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/i_540b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 607.—Aquarius.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Aquarius</span>, or the Waterbearer, may have referred to wet weather,
or as others declare, to Ganymede, the Cupbearer. There are four stars
in the waterpot like a Y; and more than
one hundred stars of small brilliancy are included
in this constellation. But here again
fancy must come to our assistance, for without
a diagram the ordinary observer could not
distinguish the Waterbearer.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_540a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 606.—Pisces.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisces</span>, the Fishes, are not plainly defined.
It is supposed that Venus and Cupid
turned themselves into fish when the Titans assailed Heaven. This Constellation
occupies a triangle in the sky.</p>



<p>The foregoing are the zodiacal constellations, and may be more easily
remembered by repeating an old rhyme, which runs as follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The Ram, the Bull, the Heavenly Twins;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Then, next the Crab, the Lion shines,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">The Virgin, and the Scales;</div>
<div class="verse">The Scorpion, Archer, and the Goat,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The Man who holds the Watering Pot,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">The Fish with Glittering tails.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The arrangement of the various Constellations
at which we have so rapidly
glanced, as well as of those that follow, has
been the work of many different periods.
Aratus and Ptolemy are the oldest enumerators,
but modern research has added immensely
to the store of knowledge. Many
of the most prominent stars were named by
Grecian and Arabian observers, and many
of the names are still retained—such as Arcturus,
Rigel, Capella, and others.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Northern Constellations.</span></p>

<p>There are, altogether, thirty-five of these, as per list on next page. It is
of course impossible to describe them all, but we will make a few remarks
respecting those which will be distinguished most readily, and the manner
of finding out particular stars. There are star maps published, and with a
little attention and reading, a great many very pleasant evening excursions
may be made across the sky, with or without a telescope. The following is
the list of the northern constellations. We have put them in various types
to indicate the most important.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Great Bear</span>, or “Charles’s Wain,” or the “Plough,” as Ursa
Major is variously called, is of great value in indicating the pole star, which,
when once known, can never be mistaken. This constellation has also been
termed the “Dipper,” and is very conspicuous in the northern hemisphere.
The three stars form the bear’s tail, or the handle of the “plough”; the
others form the body, Charles’s Wain, or “Karl-Wagen,” the German term
for peasant’s cart, is represented by the quadrangle forming the cart, and
the other three stars are the horses.</p>

<p>The “Pointers” are the two end stars, and if a line be followed northwards
from them it will lead close to <i>Polaris</i>, the principal star in the lesser
bear. This pole star is of a very great brightness, and peeps out, almost
isolated, with a pure lustre. The names of the pointers are Dubhe and
Menak. The star at the tail-tip is Benetnasch, then Mizar and Alioth.
Megrez and Phad are the remaining pair. We append a rough outline of
the bear, for the information of those who have not yet noticed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lesser Bear is not so important as his elder brother as regards
size, but he is very useful to astronomers. He resembles the Great Bear in
appearance, but is smaller, and the positions of the stars are inverted. In
the cut on page 555 (fig. 629) you see the little bear swinging round the
polar star, which is at the tip of the Lesser Bear’s tail, so any one will be
enabled to find him if they look for the polar star, and then count the three
stars away from it, and the four in the body. The Great Bear’s tail points
in the other direction. This movement of the earth’s axis by displacing the
equinoctial points, alters the “declination” and “right ascension” of the stars
(compare page 473). So Polaris is gradually approaching the actual polar
point. In about 200 years he will have got as close as he can, and will
then begin to recede from it, and in about 12,500 years after he will reach
his most distant point.</p>

<p>We need only describe Orion and Canis Major, the principal groups.
The former certainly constitutes the most glorious group, and it is visible to
all the world, because the equinoctial passes through it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Orion</span>, as we have said, can be viewed from either hemisphere, and so
can some others; but those marked with
an asterisk in the foregoing list are not

<div class="caption">Fig. 609.—Orion.</div>

<p>Orion is a very brilliant constellation,
and contains two fine stars of the first magnitude,
and some of the second. The
former are Betelgeux and Rigel. Bellatrix
is the third in order. The “belt” is formed
of three bright stars, and the sword is visible
as five stars just below. Canis Major
possesses Sirius, a very fine star (the dog
star). Canis Minor has two of the first and
second magnitude, and Hydra has one of
the first. The Southern Cross is a beautiful
constellation, invisible in our latitude, but familiar to sailors in the Southern
Seas.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 610.—Polaris.</div>
</div>

<p>When we gaze up into the sky at night, we see the stars twinkling far
away, and we may remark here that this twinkling of the
stars is due to the atmosphere and the changes in its
power of refraction, and of course the star’s light changes
its direction. But if we ascend in a balloon into very
high and rarefied strata of the air, we will find the twinkling
less. We have given the number of the stars according
to Flamstead, but the larger the telescope the greater
will be the number of stars we shall see, numbers again being too far
even for our perfected instruments.</p>

<p>But we can gain some idea of the magnitude
of the stars when we consider the distance
to arrive at, which is a most difficult task,
for figures seem scarcely long enough to count
the millions of miles, and no instrument can detect
the parallax. Even supposing the parallax
to be a very small fraction of a degree we should
get a result equalling trillions of miles. <span class="smcap">No. 61</span>
in Cygni was at one time continually observed
by Professor Bessel, and he found that its distance—and
it is the nearest star—is <em>sixty-two and a
half trillions of miles</em>.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/i_544c.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 611.—The Southern Cross.</div>
</div>

<p>Let us consider what this means. Light
comes to us from the sun (91,000,000 of
miles) in about eight minutes, and travels at the rate of something
like 186,000 miles in a second. But even at that astounding rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
the light from the star called 61 Cygni took ten years to reach the earth;
and there are stars whose light has never yet reached the earth, although the
gleam may have been travelling at 186,000 miles a second for thousands of
years. And we may presume that though we still see the light of stars,
some of them may be dead, but the light left is still progressing to us
through space.</p>

<p>So we must conclude that some stars which look large, as do Vega
and Sirius for instance, must be enormous “suns,” a great deal larger than
our sun, and the stars are each the centre of invisible systems just as our sun
is the centre of the “solar” system. Vega is a tremendous star, and
shines with her own light as do all other visible stars; for reflected light,
so very visible in the moon, which is close to us, would be quite invisible
at such tremendous distances. So we must call these stars “suns,”
and may add an apparently astonishing fact, that our own sun is merely one
of the stars in the Galaxy, or “Milky Way”!</p>

<p class="hang">DOUBLE AND MULTIPLE STARS—COLOURED AND VARIABLE STARS—CLUSTERS,
GROUPS, AND NEBULÆ—THE GALAXY, OR MILKY WAY—HOW
TO FIND OUT THE PRINCIPAL STARS.</p>


<p>Although not very clearly visible to the naked eye, there are in the sky
some pairs of stars very close together apparently; but when these double
stars are examined with a good telescope we find that
though we fancy they are two stars very close, in reality
an immense distance separates them. By Vega, which
we have already mentioned, there is apparently a star,
which on examination will be found really to be two
stars. It is also in the constellations of the Lyre, but of
much lower magnitude than Vega. But in some instances
there are three or four stars thus placed together, and
the frequency of the occurrence of this fact establishes
the farther fact that these combinations are not accidental—that the stars
are interdependent and physically connected.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_546a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 612.—γ Leonis.</div>
</div>

<p>There are now at least six thousand double stars known,<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> and this is a
very small proportion of the forty millions or so of suns which are believed to
exist in space. But of these six thousand a larger proportion have been
ascertained to be physically connected. More than six hundred of these pairs
are double suns, while again there are other combinations of three and perhaps
more. When two are thus connected we have what are termed binary
systems, and when more are associated they are called triple and multiple
stars. An example of the last-mentioned class is the small star above
mentioned near Vega. It is ε Lyræ, and is a double of a double. In
ordinary telescopes this will not be perceived, but with a high power the
combination will be noticed. The same phenomenon is observable in one
of the stars of Hercules and in Andromeda.</p>

<p>The revolution of these double suns, or binary systems, has been closely
observed, and Professor Newcomb has given us a list of the binary systems
of short period which are well determined. These are as follows:—</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that although these double stars appear close
together from our standpoint, they may be far apart—one
behind the other in a straight line. When such
“pairs” exist they are known as optical pairs, or optically
double stars, as distinguished from the actually
physical “pairs” which revolve round the centre of a
system. In Orion there has been discovered a regular
system, and the θ in Orion, which appears in a common
telescope a moderate star, and to the unaided
eye only a speck of light, is really composed of seven stars—four are set in
the form of a trapezium, as figured in the diagram in the margin by dots and
asterisks. Two of these have been ascertained to possess
attendants indicated by dots, and a seventh star was
discovered by Lassell, and Humboldt remarks that in
all probability this apparently tiny star in the constellation
Orion constitutes a real system, for the five
smaller stars have the same proper motion as the
principal one.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_547b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 614.—Trapezium of Orion (Herschel).</div>
</div>

<p>Thus our imagination almost fails to grasp the
infinity of the systems with our single sun, and with
the distant double and even triple suns round which planets revolve
perfectly independent of the other systems, as we are independent of them
possessing heat and light from their own sun or suns as we receive it
from ours, day and night seasons succeeding each other, and the wondrous
varieties of the light produced by the appearance or withdrawal of a sun
or two in the firmament of those most distant planets. These suns
being double or triple would affect each other; the composition of the
light given forth would produce—as we may assume—varying effects. We
know something about the light of the stars by the spectroscope, and the
colours of stars are due to the vapour which takes away a certain part of the
light emitted, leaving the remainder to descend through the atmosphere to us.</p>

<p>Binary stars are most numerous of the doubles; for instance Castor,
η Coronæ, Rigel, Polaris, Mivac, γ Leonis, γ Virginis, ξ Ursæ Majoris,
α Hercules, 36 Andromedæ, λ Ophiuchi, and π Aquilæ. The illustration in
the margin is Castor (or α Geminorum), the most northerly of the Twins.
The η Coronæ is also figured, as are Polaris (<i>see</i> fig. 610 <i>ante.</i>), Boötes, Rigel,
and γ Leonis.</p>

<p>The cuts herewith illustrate the relative positions at the periods named
of the “doubles,” and of the revolution of suns around other suns as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
mentioned. As a consequence of their proper motion the binary stars
appear to vary in their distances from each other, as in the topmost of the
three cuts on the (opposite) page representing γ Virginis. The stars have
gradually approached each other, and so are the stars in Castor approximating,
and when they have closed, and have appeared almost as a single star, as
they will do, they will take open order again.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">Fig. 615.—η Coronæ. &nbsp; Fig. 616.—Boötes. &nbsp;
Fig. 617.—Castor. &nbsp; Fig. 618.—Rigel.</div>
</div>

<p>The shortest time occupied by a double star in its revolution is thirty-five
years, and we have already given some of those which have been
ascertained. We will close this section with a few other examples. For
instance, γ Virginis revolves in one hundred and fifty years, Castor in
two hundred and forty years, 4 Aquarii in three hundred years, 37 Pegasi
in five hundred years. There are numerous other instances up to a period
of three thousand years, and about eight hundred of these binary systems
are known. We have mentioned that there are two or more suns in the
multiple systems. These suns are the cause of the different colours of the
stars.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Colours of the Stars.</span></p>

<p>The question of star-colour follows naturally the consideration of the
multiple stars; for although single stars have been observed of a ruddy
colour, there are no instances of a blue or green one unattended by a companion.
This colouring has been attributed to the contrast between multiple stars, for
the colours are frequently complementary; but investigation has shown that
this cannot be the case. For instances have been known in which, when
two are thus associated, and one is concealed from us, the other is just as
bright, and retains its former colour.</p>

<p>Of course in cases in which colour is apparent to the unaided vision, only
the brightest stars betray colour. Antares, Betelgeuse and Aldebaran are red
(orange) colour. Sirius and Canopus are white. Arcturus and Capella are
yellowish, so is Pollux. Vega is bluish-white. These appearances are, of
course, much more marked when the stars are examined through the
telescope, and telescopic stars—which are stars unobservable without a
glass—are very much coloured, and the multiple stars give us blue, green,
violet, and other tints, besides those already mentioned.</p>

<p>Again, these coloured stars do not always remain the same colour. Sirius
was once red; Mars was at times white. Spectrum analysis shows that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
the colours of many are due to absorption by the vapours of some of the rays;
and the existence of certain vapours may cut off some, and at other times
other vapours may exist and cut off other rays, and so the colours may be
changed. Struve gives the following list of binary complements of
“multiple” stars:—</p>

<p>We need scarcely pursue this question farther, though many ideas
concerning the coloured stars will arise in every thoughtful reader’s mind.
Supposing that every system has its sun or suns, can we fancy the effects of
a green or blue or violet sunlight—a light unmixed? To employ the
words of Sir John Herschel—“It may be more easily suggested in words
than conceived in imagination what variety of illumination two suns, a red
and a green, or a yellow and blue one, must afford to a planet circulating
round either—or what charming contrasts and graceful vicissitudes a red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
and a green day, for instance, alternating with a white one and with darkness,
might arise from the presence or absence of one or other or both above the
horizon.”</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lost and New Stars.</span></p>

<p>We may have perhaps read the “Lost Pleiad,” and wondered what has
become of the star supposed to have dropped out of the cluster so well
known in the constellation Taurus—the Pleiades. There are seven stars, of
which six are visible to the average eye, and the ancients used to declare
that one of the seven sisters (the daughters of Atlas and Pleione) hid herself
because she had married a mortal, while all her sisters wedded gods. It is
not improbable that one of the seven, formerly distinguishable with the
unassisted eye, may have disappeared or been lost; but it is certain that
strong eyesight can see more than seven now, and in the telescope there are
about one hundred.</p>

<p>And it is a fact that some stars whose places have been carefully
marked in the catalogue have subsequently disappeared. Many errors may
have been made, and stars put down where no star existed, so a succeeding
observer has not been able to find the star indicated. But, on the other hand,
we may admit that stars have been lost to sight, and to compensate us for
any such disappearances new stars are frequently observed, and these are
very remarkable phenomena. About 121 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> Hipparchus perceived a new
star, which was visible even in the daytime, and on subsequent occasions
others came into existence—viz., in the years 945, 1264, and 1572. In the
last-mentioned year Tycho Brahé suddenly perceived the new star, which
was at first very brilliant. It grew fainter and fainter, after first gaining in
intensity, and disappeared entirely in 1574; and at other times stars have
been seen which remained only for a short time, and then disappeared.</p>

<p>The star discovered by Tycho Brahé was seen by him when walking
across the fields one night, and he encountered
peasants who were gazing at the new luminary.
It was so bright that it threw a shadow from
Brahé’s stick. The new arrival appeared in
“Cassiopeia,” under the lady’s chair, forming,
as pictured in the diagram, an irregular square.
The strange star is the largest.</p>

<p>Some stars exhibit extraordinary fluctuations,
and one discovered by Mr. Birmingham
in 1866, decreased rapidly and sank away to
about the tenth magnitude, and then got brighter, and again diminished in
splendour. The “Eta” Argûs has also been subjected to many fluctuations
likewise, and such alterations have gained for these luminaries the name of
“Variable Stars.”</p>

<p>In the accompanying little chart there will be perceived two particular
stars, named Algol, “the demon,” and Mira “the wonderful.” The latter is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
the most celebrated for its variable qualities, and its cycle of change
occupies nearly one of our years. For a few
days it appears very bright, and then fades
away for about three months, to disappear
for five months, and then it reappears again,
increasing in brilliancy up to the second
magnitude for another three months or so.
Some people account for these phenomena by
stating that the sides of the star being less
luminous present the dark and light portions
in rotation; but we can give no satisfactory
explanation of the reason, unless it be caused
by an aggregation of spots upon its surface,
like sun-spots on our sun, or perhaps by
eclipse.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nebulæ</span> and <span class="smcap">Star-clusters</span> are numerous
in the heavens. The most important are the
Great Nebulæ in Orion and in Andromeda. But
there are other
very beautiful
“patches”
of luminous
matter or cloud
appearances composed of minute stars
invisible to the naked eye. We annex
specimens of the Nebulæ, one or two having been already inserted.
There must be thousands of these star-clouds, and they have been
classified by Sir John Herschel from Sir William’s discoveries as follows:—</p>

<p class="hang">(1) Clusters of stars, in
which the stars are
clearly distinguishable,
divided again
into regular and irregular
clusters.</p>

<p class="hang">(2) Resolvable Nebulæ,
which may be separated
into distinct
stars under powerful
telescopes.</p>

<p class="hang">(3) Nebulæ, in which there
is no appearance
whatever of stars, divided into classes according to brightness, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>(4) Planetary Nebulæ.</p>

<p>(6) Nebulous Stars.</p></blockquote>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_551c.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 625.—Dumb bell Nebulæ.</div>
</div>

<p>We learn also from the foregoing authority that Nebulæ affect a certain
district; that is, they have, as it were, a preference for it, and are not distributed
in a random manner over the heavens, and are found in Leo, Leo
Minor, Ursa Major, Canes Venatici, Coma, Böotes, and Virgo, and more
sparingly in Aries, Taurus, Orion, Perseus, Draco, Hercules, Lyra, etc.
Nebulæ are found associated with stars, as is the case with η Argus; these
are called nebulous stars, and in the case of this particular star many very
interesting investigations have been made. The Nebulæ are as equally variable
as the stars they surround.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_552a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 626.—Nebulæ in Perseus.</div>
</div>

<p>What is termed the Nebular Hypothesis was put forward by La Place,
and by it he endeavoured to account
for the regular development of the
stellar system, which is supposed to
have originated from an immense
nebular cloud. This immense mass
would rotate and contract, and the
outer portions would separate and
develop in rings like Saturn’s rings.
Then the rings break into separate
portions, and each portion condenses
into a planet, or the small “bits” travel
round the sun like asteroids, and in
this manner various systems were formed. This theory was considered to
be quite exploded when stars were discerned in nebulæ by the more recent
telescopes; but then the spectroscope came to our aid, and it was discovered
that there were some nebulæ which are simply masses of glowing gas or
aggregations of stones which are dashing
against each other in so forcible a manner
as to produce heat and luminosity. Mr.
Lockyer appears to favour the latter theory
as to nebulæ.</p>

<p>Mr. Proctor, however, has put forward
a hypothesis that the star or meteor showers
are the original cause of the sidereal system,
and this rain of meteors has fallen for all
time, gradually consolidating into orbs. The
fact that the constituents of sun, earth and
planets, comets and meteors being fundamentally the same lends probability
to this hypothesis, which is fully explained by the author.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Milky Way.</span></p>

<p>The Galaxy is familiar to all readers, and although visible all the year
round, is perceived more plainly in August, September, and October, or at
the beginning and ending of that period. This zone of stars was of course
well known to the ancients, but it is to Galileo that we owe the first
important information about the Galaxy; he decided that it was formed of
stars. Sir John Herschel investigated the subject very closely, and to him
much of the information concerning the Milky Way is due.</p>

<p>It is not very distinct in the north, but as it advances from Cepheus
southwards by the Unicorn, it gets clearer, and opens out in Argo, and
descends still south, becoming brighter near the Southern Cross. It then
passes northward again, dividing into two branches, one of which dies out,
and then over Sagittarius, and so on to Cygnus, then to Casseopeia and the
starting-point. The number of stars in the Galaxy is about 18,000,000.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_553.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 628.—The Milky Way.</div>
</div>

<p>In this wonderful zone of stars the centre of our system, the sun, is
placed. It was supposed to be divided as in the diagram above; the inner
portion being the stars seen in their thickness, and the outer ring representing
the stars viewed in the direction of the length and breadth. But afterwards,
Herschel modified his opinions respecting the Milky Way, and since his
death many astronomers—and Mr. Proctor more particularly—have devoted
considerable time to an examination of this wonderful zone of stars; which,
it must be remembered, is not a continuous stream; it is a series of luminous
patches. On this point Professor Nichol says:—</p>

<p>“It is only to the most careless glance that the Milky Way appears a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
continuous zone. Let the naked eye rest thoughtfully on any part of it,
and if circumstances are favourable, it will stand out rather as an accumulation
of patches and streams of light in every conceivable variety of form
and brightness; now side by side, now heaped on each other, again spanning
across dark spaces ... and at other times darting off into the neighbouring
skies in branches of capricious length and shape, which gradually thin
away and disappear.”</p>

<p>The Milky Way has its greatest breadth in the “Swan,” and in the
“Eagle” constellation it divides itself. In the “Southern Triangle” the
zone is brightest, and in the “Southern Cross” the hole or space, termed by
sailors the “Coal Sack,” is very distinct. It then contracts and expands,
and there is in Argo another gap. Then it is lost for a space, then it
branches out, and soon crosses the Equator, dilates, contracts, opens out
again, and so returns to the “Swan” again.</p>

<p>Philosophers have frequently discoursed upon this phenomenon, but all
statements must remain more or less speculative. From Kepler’s to the
present time astronomers have been considering the Milky Way, and when
the Nebular theory was given up, when the Galaxy was found to be composed
of stars, there was, as we have noticed, the idea of the ring and
the cloven disc. Mr. R. Proctor has likened the Galaxy to a coiled serpent,
and considers the openings in the Milky Way as evidence that the stratum
of stars is limited, and that here we can see beyond it. In fact, it would
appear that it is a very complicated question; and as the zone itself is
complicated “with outlying branches beyond the range of our most powerful
telescopes,” so an actual knowledge of the Milky Way is beyond us at
present. It is composed of most extraordinary aggregations of stars, which
appear not only impossible to count, but each one to be independent of the
other. Thus we must conclude our rapid survey of the Milky Way, and
close with Mr. Proctor’s remark in his “Universe of Stars.” “The sidereal
system,” he says, “is altogether more complicated, altogether more varied
in structure than has hitherto been supposed. Within one and the same
region co-exist stars of many orders of real magnitude, the greatest being
thousands of times larger than the least. All the Nebulæ hitherto discovered,
whether gaseous or stellar, irregular, planetary, ring-formed, or
elliptic, exist within the limits of the sidereal system. They all form part
and parcel of that wonderful system, whose nearer and brighter parts
constitute the glories of our nocturnal heavens.”</p>

<p>And a little reflection will show how true this is. Not very long ago
in the world’s life the solar system was supposed to consist of one sun with
a few planets wandering around him. Then some more were found, and
they were called “satellites.” For a long time man fancied he had reached
the “ultima thule” of astronomy in these depths; but the whole idea was
changed when it was discovered that beyond Mars there lie the asteroids
and the host of bodies in this solar system which we cannot do more than
allude to. Then when we consider that this “sun” of ours, which we think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
so enormous, and which keeps in subjection so many heavenly bodies, and
illuminates them; when we reflect that there are in space, and visible,
stars many times larger than our ruling star, each a sun, and that our sun
would, if put where the great Sirius glows, be but a speck in the firmament,
and his system invisible to our eyes, we may well wonder at the magnitude
of the subject, and the Infinite Wisdom and Power “that telleth the number
of the stars, and calleth them all by their names.”</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 629.—The “Swing” of the Lesser Bear.</div>
</div>

<p>A few particulars, to enable a reader to identify the most prominent
stars, may be given as starting-points from which some few excursions into
the spangled heavens may be attempted.
But the suggestions must be considered
with reference to the ever-varying directions
of the supposed lines in consequence
of the daily revolution of the sphere. We
have illustrated this in the cut in the
margin, wherein the Lesser Bear is shown
as swinging round the Polar Star in different
positions. Sometimes the lines of
direction will be vertical, sometimes inclined,
but all retaining their relative
positions.</p>

<p>We have already learnt that the
“pointers” of the Great Bear indicate
the Polar Star in the Lesser Bear, and we
can (roughly) estimate the distance between the pointers as 5°. This will
give us the distance between the pointers and the Polar Star as 29°. By
following an imaginary line through the two northern stars of the “Waggon”
(the Bear) away from the “horses,” we shall find Capella about 50° away.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_555b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 630.—Diagram of the Pole Star.</div>
</div>

<p>If we pass from the first star next the waggon of “Charles’s Wain” to
the Pole Star, and past it, we shall arrive at an irregular W. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
Cassiopeia, about as far beyond Polaris as the Bear is below it. When the
latter is low, the former is at the zenith, and so on.</p>

<p>A line drawn from the Pole Star through the end star of the Great
Bear leads to Arcturus. A line taken from Arcturus for about an equal
distance will, with the Pole Star, make a triangle with Vega. The Polar
Star may be called the Apex.</p>

<p>Regulus may be found southwards by drawing a line through the two
first stars of the square in the Bear (opposite the pointers). From Vega, almost
opposite the Pole Star, and through it about twice as far away on the other
side, is Sirius, a brilliant “sun.” Procyon will be found to the westward of
Regulus about 30°. From Procyon to the Pole Star a line will pass through
Pollux and Castor.</p>

<p>Another line from the pole star through the middle of the three
“horses” in the “Wain” will reach Spica Virginis about 70° beyond. So
we can describe a large triangle with Spica, Regulus, and Arcturus, at the
angles. Regulus is the apex, Spica and Arcturus a short base line.</p>

</div>

<p>From the pole star through Capella, passing between Betelgeux and
Bellatrix, we shall describe a line leading to the three stars of Orion’s belt.
Between it and the Pleiades is Aldebaran.</p>

<p>There are many other stars which could be indicated; but on a fine
evening, if the observer will mark them upon a piece of paper, placing
the pole star in the centre, he will be able to add to his star map very
rapidly.</p>

<p>In the foregoing chapters of Astronomy we have seen how the earth
and other planets move around the sun; we have glanced at the “fixed”
stars and their groups, termed the constellations, and have noted the planets
and their characteristics, with many other interesting facts. There is yet
a great deal to be learnt, and much study will be required with daily
(nightly) observations before the young reader will obtain success as a
student of astronomy; but there is no study so interesting. We have
seen what a very small portion of the universe is occupied by our solar
system, and what a speck our earth is on the plain of creation. We find
ourselves on the border-land of the incomprehensible, and we are lost in
speculations upon the unseen.</p>

<small>NEW ASTRONOMICAL APPLIANCES.</small></h2>

<p class="hang">A CELESTIAL INDICATOR—ASTRONOMICAL OR COSMOGRAPHICAL CLOCK—A
SIMPLE GLOBE—A SOLAR CHRONOMETER.</p>


<p>Having said something concerning astronomy, we will give a few
instructions respecting the instruments not already described, and make
some observations, supplementing our directions in the previous chapter,
for many people will be glad to learn how to read the evening skies.</p>

<p>Here we have an apparatus which will prove useful to amateurs; it
is a sort of celestial indicator by Mauperin, and will facilitate the finding of
every star or constellation, when the apparatus has been made ready by
pointing the rod, <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>, in the direction of the object it is desired to view.
This rod is mounted upon a rod, <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, and is movable upwards or downwards
or sideways, and in the last-named movement it will carry with it an
indicator, <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, which slides over the chart or diagram of the heavens. The
two arms of this indicator are always parallel to the plane of the rod, <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>,
no matter in what position they may be on the chart or the inclination
of the rod. The extremities of this rod are terminated by an eye-slit, and
by a crescent respectively.</p>

<p>When the apparatus is set, all one has to do is to look through the
eye aperture, <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>, and view the star which we have chosen in the centre
of the crescent, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>. This star will be found named in the space between the
arms of the sliding indicator, <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>.</p>

<p>It is easy to perform the operation inversely—that is to say, to find
in the sky, by means of the sighting-rod, <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>, the stars we have chosen on
the chart between the prongs of the indicator. The chart represents
exactly the heavens as we see them, and this new mode is opposed to
the manner generally adopted with celestial charts, and is very important,
for it obviates the necessity of holding the map above one’s head, its face
downwards.</p>

<p>As we have already showed, it is not difficult to find the Polar Star
and the Great Bear. The latter is readily recognised by its seven stars,
and the Lesser Bear glides around the pole as shown in the diagram on the
preceding page (fig. 629). Now let us see how the celestial indicator will
work.</p>

<p>Let us take the apparatus into the open air, and place it upon its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
tripod stand. The upper portion will be found movable by loosening the
screw, <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span>. By another simple arrangement the table can be slanted, and
by turning a screw we can entirely slope the side of the chart where
midnight (<i lang="fr">minuit</i>) is written. Being placed opposite the polar star we take
the upper part of the chart by the button, <span class="smcap lowercase">G</span>, and bring it before us by a
horizontal rotative movement.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_558.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 632.—Celestial Indicator.</div>
</div>

<p>We now place the sliding indicator upon midday (<i lang="fr">midi</i>), and keep it
in that position while working the apparatus—that is, until we have caught
sight of the polar star in the centre of the crescent, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, by means of the
eye aperture, <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>. We have now obtained the meridian, and care should be
taken to tighten the screw, <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span>. Then the table is raised to its fixed place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
upon the support; it is regulated according to the latitude of the place, and
the apparatus is then “oriented.”</p>

<p>The upper disc is an elliptical opening, or aperture, which contains for
every moment the stars visible upon the horizon, and the circumference is
furnished with a graduated scale of hours divided into five-minute divisions,
and this is fixed upon the apparatus. The dotted line between the midday
and midnight points gives the meridian.</p>

<p>The disc placed underneath is the celestial chart, on the circumference
of which we shall find the days of the months. It can be moved around
the rod, <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, which represents the axis of the earth around which the heavens
are supposed to revolve. When the stars have to be observed, the day
of the month has to be brought to the time at which the observation is
about to be made. We can easily read off the chart by looking through
the eye-piece as already explained. Every five minutes it is necessary to
move the chart one division, which indicates that five minutes have passed;
(other stars are, of course, arriving). The apparatus can be packed away
when done with, or the bearings taken, and then the trouble of getting it
into position again need not be repeated.</p>

<p>A small lamp, <span class="smcap lowercase">L</span>, throws its light upon the chart in such a way that
the eyes of the observer are not incommoded, while the table is fully
illuminated. It can be placed at <span class="smcap lowercase">L´</span> if necessary. The inclination varies
according to the latitude of the place when the observations are made.
There is an arrangement underneath which admits of this inclination
according to longitude.</p>

<p>The apparatus can also be made available to ascertain what the aspect
of the heavens will be upon any particular evening of the month. We
have only to place the chart at the day and hour, and we shall then see
upon it all the stars visible above the horizon. We can thus find out at
what time the stars rise and set, and those which do not set—to find the
hour at which they pass the meridian (the line drawn between midday and
midnight upon the chart), and the time of their appearance on the horizon.
When the sliding indicator, <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, does not show a star that is discoverable in the
sky, the observer may conclude that he is viewing a planet. This apparatus
is well adapted for beginners in astronomy, as no deep preparatory study is
necessary, and the tyro can read the sky as easily as he could read a book.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Cosmographical Clock.</span></p>

<p>We have, in the foregoing chapters upon Astronomy, endeavoured to
give the reader some idea respecting the inclination of the earth and its
rotation, and writers have often endeavoured to devise an apparatus which
shall show the position of the globe in space, its diurnal motion—even its
inclination and the succession of seasons in its revolution round the sun.
But such reproductions of simultaneous movements have hitherto been
obtained only on a very large scale, which find their place well enough
in the museum or lecture-room, but which it is quite impossible to utilize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
in our sitting-rooms, on our tables, or chimney-pieces. Besides, the usual
apparatus employed is a very costly one, and only serves for occasional
representation; it will not keep the facts constantly before the observer
in the manner of a clock showing the time.</p>

<p>But for all who are interested in Astronomy, or in Cosmography, or
even for a young person who desires merely to understand the reality of
the earth’s motion and how our earth is placed in the universe—for any one
who deems it of use that he or she should be able to see the signs and the
seasons, and the days and years, and how the earth revolves, may obtain an
astronomical or cosmographical clock, which will tell him or her how the
“world wags”; a useful as well as an ornamental timepiece.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_560.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 633.—Cosmographical clock.</div>
</div>

<p>Now this is precisely the result which
the talented inventor of the astronomical
clock has arrived at. M. Mouret devoted
a great portion of his life and all his
available means to the realization of his
great idea, and, sad to say, he died miserably
in an attic the very day before his
great and deserving effort brought him the
reward for which he had so painfully striven
and devoted himself to by a life of self-denial
and labour.</p>

<p>M. Mouret communicated to his globe
the astronomical movement, which our
earth possesses, by the aid of clock-work,
which conveys to it, second by second, at
each stroke of the pendulum, the double
movement of rotation and progression.
The globe turns upon its axis in twenty-four
hours, and thus one can perceive,
without any mental effort, the rotation of
our planet, and the portions of the globe
which come under the influence of the
sun in rotation, just as they do actually on the earth. Not the least
interesting attribute of this ingenious arrangement is the fact that
during breakfast or dinner one can see the displacement and revolution of
the earth with reference to the sun to all people in the world. Here, on
the meridian, all are at midday. There, on the left, near the circle which
defines the limit between day and night, the sun is rising and day is beginning;
opposite, on the right, the sun is setting and day is closing. Yonder is the
Pacific Ocean in full daylight, while almost every continent is in darkness
and the inhabitants wrapped in slumber. Now the Chinese are opening
their eyes, and the Asiatic and European continents will soon be illuminated
and awake. This is the movement of the world as it has ever been since
time came into its calculations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span></p>

<p>The ingenious inventor, who wished to make a clock of his apparatus,
and not being able to change its place on the earth from day to day as the
time changed, very cleverly reproduced the sun’s movement of declination
by making it describe a double cone at the axis of the globe. At the
equinoxes the poles are in a plane, and equal day and night are shown. At
the winter solstice the north pole is inclined backwards at an angle 23° 28´,
and our hemisphere is in the winter season. We have then only eight
hours’ daylight and sixteen of darkness; six months later the pole is
inclined towards the sun, and the southern pole is plunged in darkness.
We have the long days and the southerners the long nights. An upright
dial shows the time of the country in which the globe may happen to be,
and one can ascertain at any moment what time it is anywhere else. A
horizontal dial indicates the day of the month, and changes every day in
a manner corresponding with the movement of the earth around the sun,
reproduced by means of the arrangement with the double cone. The spectator
is supposed to be turning his back to the sun.</p>

<p>We may add that these movements are all self-acting, and there is
no need to interfere with the clock, which is wound up like ordinary timepieces.
By an ingenious forethought the inventor provided that the sphere
should be independent of the other movements, and it can be used for
demonstration in the hands of the lecturer, and be explained with all its
motions without in any way disarranging the clock-work. The globe must,
of course, when replaced, be put exactly at the correct day and hour.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Simple Terrestrial Globe.</span></p>

<p>A terrestrial globe without any mechanism, so long as its axis is
parallel to that of the earth, <em>exposed to the direct rays of the sun</em>, represents
our planet with its recurrence of day and night.</p>

<p>The figure (634) shows us a globe without any support. The axis is
north and south, and makes, with the horizon, an angle equal to the latitude
of Paris, if the support, <span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span>, be horizontal. To make the axis of the globe
parallel to the axis of our earth, the line, <span class="smcap lowercase">N S</span>, must correspond to the
meridian of the place; this can be done with the compass, for instance.</p>

<p>The solar rays always illuminate one-half of a sphere, no matter what
its dimensions. If we look at the illustration we shall see that the line of
separation between the light and dark portions of the globe corresponds
with that in our earth. This globe, then, tells us the passage of light and
darkness for the day, and even for the moment of the day, when it is
turned as the earth moves. The place examined should be placed in the
meridian of that place (Paris, for instance), and occupy the most elevated
spot on the globe. The earth is then in just the same position, and
daylight and darkness are shown exactly as they exist on the earth at
the time.</p>

<p>If this globe be then observed for a few minutes, the sun will be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
rising and setting, as it were, in various places (we must remember we have
concentrated the <em>sun’s</em> rays, not a lamp, upon the globe). The places on
the right, if the observer be placed facing the sun, will come out of the
shade, and those on the left will enter it. The former are then really
enjoying the sunrise, and the others are actually witnessing his setting.</p>

<p>The globe represented, making the double revolution of our planet
in the year, will reproduce all the actual phenomena of day and night as
taking place on the earth itself if we stand at a little distance so as to
observe it all at once.</p>

<p>Of course, the employment of this simple apparatus should not exclude
more complicated ones, for the former can only be used on a fine bright
day. But the advantage claimed for it is that in it we can imitate nature
exactly. Illuminated, as it is, by the real sun, the portions of light and
shade are indicated by the rays and not by a metallic circle.</p>

<p>In order that the line of demarcation may be exactly defined, it will
be necessary that the sun’s rays be concentrated upon the globe, and that
no lateral or vertical light be admitted. The curtains should therefore be
so arranged, and the blinds pulled down to a certain point, and if the stand
or support be painted black it will be found an advantage. If the globe be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
a small one, it will be sufficient to place the stand upon an ordinary table,
without verifying the horizontal plane. With a large globe the arrangement
must be very exact.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Solar Chronometer.</span></p>

<p>M. Flechet’s chronometer, of which we give an illustration, is a kind
of equitorial reduced to its most simple form. It is possible to ascertain
the exact time by it very easily. It consists of a disc, <span class="smcap lowercase">AB</span>, divided into
twenty-four hours and fractions of hours. This disc turns upon itself
around an arc, <span class="smcap lowercase">CD</span>, which has a direction parallel to the axis of the world,
and can be moved on a joint, <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>, according to the latitude of the place;
<span class="smcap lowercase">F</span> is a lens which can be moved and presented to the sun at any time,
forming the centre of a concave and exactly spherical plate represented
at <span class="smcap lowercase">GH</span>.</p>

<p>When the instrument is fixed so that the axis, <span class="smcap lowercase">CD</span>, is parallel to the
axis of the globe, the disc, <span class="smcap lowercase">AB</span>, is turned so that the centre of the image of
the sun, produced by the lens, shall fall at <i>m</i>. The real time is found by
an examination of the position of the index, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, upon the hour graduations
of the disc. A French writer, Ch. Delounay, has mentioned this instrument,

<p>When we were at school, and learnt the various countries of Europe, we
had maps showing us the several divisions of one realm from another; the
mountains, lakes, and other prominent features of the continent were learned
and repeated, but we, maybe, seldom, perhaps never, bestowed a thought
upon the formations of the mountains, and the manner in which rivers ran
down into and through lakes to the ocean. There were the mountains, there
were the lakes and rivers, and capes, and headlands, and there they are still,
to all intents and purposes, the same to see, to climb up, to sail down, as
the case may be. But the map of Europe has undergone a visible change.
Territory has changed hands. Germany has gripped France, England has
got Cyprus, Turkey has been dismembered, and Austria is annexing territory.
This study is called Geography,—<span class="smcap">Political Geography</span>,—for it marks the
political boundaries. The knowledge of the formation of hills, headlands,
lakes, rivers, seas, their causes, constitution, and effects, how they rose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
how they exist and wax or wane during the course of centuries is <span class="smcap">Physical
Geography</span>, which we propose to consider.</p>

<p>This tree of knowledge includes some very important branches, almost
parent stems. As a magnificent oak spreads forth its brawny arms, with
smaller branches and twigs, each of these great branches being as large as
an ordinary tree, so Physical Geography includes other arms such as
Geology, Meteorology, Botany, and Physiology—even Astronomy in its
comprehensive embrace. We find it is a difficult task to separate these
kindred sciences from the great tree. We may have therefore to refer to
earth, air, and water, and their various forms in hills and mountains, wind,
vapour, rain, glaciers, and sea. We must learn how this earth has been
gradually cooled, and what the various stages of its growth have done. We
must consider plant and animal life upon our planet, and how the atmosphere
affects them. All this is Physical Geography, and its satellite sciences of
Geology, Meteorology, “Climatology,” Botany, and Physiology.</p>

<p>“Everything must have a beginning,” and the earth must have had a
beginning, although the actual manner of the physical creation of the planet
is a disputed fact. We are not about to discuss the religious side of the
question, although we should undoubtedly find that Biblical and Geologic
teaching run side by side towards the same end, and the testimony of the
earth and sky bears witness to the Divine hand that created the universe,
which we can trace back to the dim and distant ages when “the earth was
without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep.”</p>

<p>With this brief preface, let us consider some of these aspects, and pick
up interesting facts from the ground.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Geology.</span></p>

<p>In the chemical and mineral sections of this volume we have heard
something concerning the formation of the globe and its composition, its
clays, rocks, etc. With these internal arrangements Chemistry and Mineralogy
have dealt. Geology tells us about the external surface of the earth,
its stones and rocks, and how they were formed, and generally something
about the conformation of the crust of the earth, and its history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span></p>

<p>When we speak of “crust” of the earth, we do not simply mean the
exterior layer of gravel, clay, or stone. The crust is a thick one, and our
crust extends just so far as we can cut into it. The surface of the sea can
scarcely be termed a crust, but we must penetrate that ever-moving liquid
boundary, and touch upon (and examine) what lies down below far beyond
the “full fathom five” of the lead line. In this study we must not forget
our Book of Nature, which is always open and inviting us to read. We
shall see how things are produced, and how our physical surroundings will
continue to be produced until the age of miracles returns, and Providence
sees fit to interfere with the otherwise immutable laws which He in His
wisdom has laid down for the universe.</p>

<p>It will be of no use to go back into space and imagine the world a
red-hot fragment of matter, whirling through the heaven around the sun
which, as a larger aggregation of burning atoms, kept it, as it now keeps it,
in its place. The earth was a globe of liquid fire, or in gaseous state, and
the atoms gradually cooled on the surface; the fire is still under our feet.
The outer part would by degrees lose all its heat, while the interior remained
hot; the planet must then have been surrounded by a steamy atmosphere,
and enveloped in vapours condensed from the air through which no light
of the sun could by any appreciable degree penetrate.</p>

<p>We can give an example of this, and it will be seen how the surface of
the earth gradually became formed from the vaporous condition. If any
one will take the pains to evaporate any saline solution in a capsule till it
is about to crystallise, and observe attentively the pellicle of salt as it forms
on the surface; first a partial film will show itself in a few places, floating
about and joining with others, then when nearly the whole surface is coated,
it will break up in some places and sink into the liquid beneath, another
pellicle will form and join with the remains of the first, and as this thickens
it will push up ridges and inequalities of the surface from openings and
fissures in which little jets of steam and fluid will escape; these little ridges
are chains of mountains, the little jets of steam those volcanic eruptions
which were at that period so frequent, the surface of the capsule is the
surface of the earth, and the five minutes which the observer has contemplated
it, a million years.</p>

<p>The next effect of the cooling of the earth would be the gradual
condensation of the vapour of water with which it was surrounded; this
falling upon the earth formed seas and oceans, leaving only the higher
portions exposed above its level. The clearing up of the dense dark clouds
for the first time let in upon the earth’s surface the glorious and vivifying rays
of the sun, and this great effect possibly accords with the earliest record in
the Bible of the acts of creation: “And God said, let there be light, and
there was light.”</p>

<p>This clearing up of the vapours and the subsequent rain no doubt gave
rise to terribly grand electrical phenomena—thunderings and lightnings. By
degrees the waters got their own way, and then many changes took place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
land and water fighting, as it were, for the mastery, as they are fighting
to this day.</p>

<p>But perhaps some reader may not think that the land and water of our
earth are thus engaged. A very few minutes’ reflection will suffice to
confirm our assertion. Look at the lofty crags in the Alps, for instance;
what has shattered those peaks, and sent the masses toppling down in stone
avalanches to the lower slopes, and then into the valleys?—Water. Water
has been in the crevices, and was frozen there; in freezing it expanded and
loosened the crags, which, forced asunder, gave an opening to more snow and
ice, and so this powerful leverage, aided by the wind and storm, is disintegrating
our mountains.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_567.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 638.—Breakers on the coast of Cornwall.</div>
</div>

<p>It is the same by the seashore; the cliffs are wearing away, and the
sea approaches; at other places the sea recedes from the land, as coral
formation and embryo chalk cliffs are rising under the surface of the ocean.
Lakes dry up, and the meadow or farm arises on the site, while other old spots
are submerged. No rest, no change of idea, but ever changing in physical
appearance, Nature goes on her wondrous way, working now as steadily,
as harmoniously, and as surely as she did before time was, and as she will
continue to do when time shall be no more!</p>

<p>In our investigations into Geology we cannot enter into many technical
details. Our object in these pages is recreation; but we shall, even under
these circumstances, find plenty to interest, and sufficient to lead any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
who wishes to pursue the study for himself. We will endeavour so to put
the features of the stones and rocks before him that they will be recognized
by the passer by. We will try to show how the earth has been built up,
and how the great and terrible changes through which our little globe has
passed have been effected. In our own islands, Great Britain and Ireland,
we shall find traces of all the materials likely to be useful to us in our quest,
As has been well said, “Geology is the Physical Geography of the past.”</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Constitution of the Earth.</span></p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_568a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 639.—Shells in chalk.</div>
</div>

<p>The descent from rocks to stones, from stones to gravel, from gravel
to sand, is evident to everyone, so we need
not insist upon the fact that sand is powdered
rock, and that an aggregation of sand
particles makes stones. We have heard in
the <cite>Mineralogy</cite> section that there are certain
“earths”—silica, alumina, lime, etc. Of
these “earths,” the two former constitute the
greater portion of the <span class="smcap lowercase">ROCKS</span>. Lime, also, is
very evident, and in limestones fossils or
organic remains are abundant. Now we
must entirely put away from our minds the
old idea that the earth we live on was created
at once, or as it appeared to the first human
beings. Our planet was prepared for man by degrees during millions of
years. We conclude that the earth was originally composed of certain
elements, and we find the same elements
in the sun. Therefore, supposing
(as is supposed) that the earth
came from the sun, we have all the
material of the globe in a fused
state. As the earth cooled, rocks
were formed by pressure, and then
water came, and now we can read
“books in the running brooks, and
sermons in stones” at our leisure.</p>

<p>Perhaps as someone reads this
he may be walking by the seashore
kicking the pebbles or seated
upon the sands, the grains of which
are so very tiny. He will probably
find sand, shingle, and gravel within
reach, and perhaps the curious-looking
“pudding stone.” Now
what can we learn from these stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
or sand grains or that curious bit of <em>conglomerate</em>? Perhaps the reader
may be at Ramsgate or Margate or another place where the “white cliffs
of Albion” glisten in the sun. Take up a piece of chalk and examine
it. It is soft and soils your hands, and you will throw it away, perhaps—but
don’t. Take it home and put it under the microscope or a good magnifying
glass. What do you see?</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i_569b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 642.—Limestone with encrinites.</div>
</div>

<p>You will find the <em>remains of animals</em>—that is, shells and tiny bits of
coral packed close together. Under the
microscope they will become more separated,
and the grains will be distinct
fragments of shells, etc. If this little
bit of chalk be composed of marine
animals’ shells, of course the whole cliff
is composed of the same kind of material.
But how did the shells get into the chalk?
Shells are chalk—carbonate of lime;
lime was deposited at the bottom of the
sea, and the infinite millions of minute
animals formed themselves shells, and
left them to be piled up by Nature’s forces into cliffs during countless
ages.</p>

<p>Yes, but how did the lime get into the water to make the shells? We
will endeavour to explain. Rain, when falling, takes some carbonic acid
from the air, which we know contains it. This acts upon the lime in the
rocks (lime is oxide of calcium, and calcium is an element in the earth), so we
get a bi-carbonate of lime (soluble in water), which rises from the rocks in
springs. These springs and their streams deposit lime, as we can see in
caverns where we find stalactites and stalagmites. The lime is transmitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
to the ocean, and absorbed by the crinoideans and molluscs which produced
shells. These shells hardened and crystallized became limestone, and whole
mountains are formed of this “organic” rock, which is used for so many
purposes.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_570.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 643.—Chalk cliff.</div>
</div>

<p>We have spoken of <span class="smcap">Organic Rocks</span>, but there are others, and we
ought, perhaps, to have spoken of that
kind before the chalk put them aside.
Let us go back to our sandy shore again
and look at the <span class="smcap">Sedimentary Rocks</span>,
which are the very first formation. We
have all seen sandstone, and visitors to
the South Devon Coast will remember
the red cliffs near Dawlish and Teignmouth.
These are red sandstone—not
the very “old red” so pleasantly written
of by Hugh Miller, but at any rate sandstone,
and composed of grains of sand.
When we were at Dawlish last year a
piece of the sandstone had fallen on to
the beach, and when the waves came up
that stone was no doubt gradually washed away into sand, and then fell to
the earth as <em>sediment</em>.</p>

<p>We said something a few pages back about the wear and tear which is
always going on: the mountain is worn away—a mass falls, it is broken into
smaller pieces; these are carried by a river; the mud is deposited, and the
finer particles are ground and rounded into gravel, and finally sand. Beneath
the current of the river, and at the bottom of a lake or sea, these sediments
(mud, etc.) accumulate one on the top of the other in regular series called
<em>strata</em>, and then the weight and pressure acting with the soluble mineral
deposits always washing down, consolidate and bind the loose sand-grains
into stone, which, in the course of ages, hardens. The stones thus formed
from sediments such as gravel, mud, and sand, are termed <em>Sedimentary Rocks</em>;
they have become rocks by enormous and continuous pressure. Thus:—</p>

<p class="p10">
Sands have become “Sandstones”;<br />
Gravel has become “Pudding-stone” (Conglomerate);<br />
Mud and clay have become “Shale”;<br />
Calcareous deposits have become “Limestone”;<br />
Vegetable deposits have become “Coal.”<br />
</p>

<p>So we have sandy, clayey, limy, flinty, and corally rocks under long
names respectively—Arenarious, Argillaceous, Calcareous, Silicious; and
we may add Bitumenous and Ferruginous—Irony Rocks—to the list.</p>

<p>Speaking of sediments, it is curious to note the different colours of the
Arve and the Rhone which meet near Geneva. The white sedimentary
Arve can be traced for a long distance beside, not mixing with, the blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
Rhone. The same effect can be traced where the latter river enters the
Lake of Geneva. So the land is being perpetually
carried away and deposited; and where water
gains on land there is somewhere else always a
corresponding elevation to compensate it. Thus
places disappear, and the sea washes over the site, as
on the Kentish Coast, where Earl Godwin’s land was
inundated, and new land is reclaimed or is elevated
from the sea to make up the balance.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“There rolls the deep, where grew the tree;</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, earth, what changes hast thou seen!</div>
<div class="verse">There, where the long street roars, has been</div>
<div class="verse">The stillness of the central sea.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We have spoken of sedimentary
and organic rocks. There
is yet another kind called igneous,
or fiery rocks—those upraised by
volcanic action. Of the igneous
rocks the crystalline have been
evidently in a fused condition. Granite is an example; lava or basalt is
the usual term for volcanic rock, and the basaltic caves of Staffa and the
Giants’ Causeway bear testimony to the igneous or volcanic origin of the surroundings.
The pillars and fantastic rocks of Ireland and Scotland which
are so remarkable, are simply lava, which was erupted in a molten state, now
cooled and contracted into blocks of curious regularity of form.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_571a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 644.—Trap rock (Staffa).</div>
</div>

<p>Granite, already referred
to, is another igneous rock,
and must have been forced
upwards; for as an igneous
rock granite has cooled beneath
the crust of the earth,
throwing out arms, while melting,
into other formations,
and frequently being found in
mountains. There is another
kind of igneous rocks formed
by the continuous accumulation
of the ashes, etc., vomited
forth from volcanoes. Masses
of mountain are thus produced
in the course of years, and the
material thus formed is called <em>tufa</em>, or tuff, when consolidated; and this
(now solidified) is what caused the destruction of Pompeii and
Herculaneum.</p>

<div class="figright">

<div class="caption">Fig. 645.—Eruption of granite.</div>
</div>

<p>So we have two classes of <span class="smcap">Igneous Rocks</span>, the Crystalline and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
Fragmental (or the “Plutonic” and “Volcanic”), including basalts, pitchstones,
pumice, trachytes, granite, syenite, etc.; and, on the other hand, tuff and
“volcanic” breccia, with felstones, porphyries, etc., which have been classed as
intermediary.</p>

<p>Of these three classes of rocks, the sedimentary and the organic
compose the greater portion of the earth. We will now glance at the crust
of the earth and its various formations.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Palæzoic Systems.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laurentian System.</span> It will be perceived
from the above list that the Laurentian Rocks are
the oldest. The name is derived from the St.
Lawrence formations, and was given to the strata by
Sir William Logan. They are metamorphosed rocks
older than the Cambrian. These rocks are sedimentary,
of very old deposition, and of a crystalline
nature, consisting of quartz, gneiss, etc. The granite
was probably formed by the fusion of its component constituents, quartz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
mica, and felspar, which become crystallized by the excessive heat. For a
long time no traces of organisms could be detected in this or the Cambrian
systems, but modern research has been rewarded with a little success.
The original deposits of micaceous gneiss, etc., have been altered, and many
true igneous rocks, such as syenite and granite, are found in them. These
very old rocks must have been originally deposited in strata converted by
heat and pressure into crystalline rocks. These rocks have been divided into
two series, under the names of lower and upper Laurentian. They are
metamorphic, and consist “mainly of gneiss interstratified with mica-schist,
with great beds of quartz, and massive beds of crystalline limestone, of which
one varies from 700 to 1,500 feet in thickness. Conglomerates also occur,
and there are vast deposits of magnetic and specular iron. Graphite, or
blacklead, is disseminated in strings, veins, and beds through hundreds of
feet of the lower Laurentian, and its amount is calculated by Dr. Dawson
to be equal in quantity to the coal seams of an equal area of the carboniferous
rocks” (Nicholson).</p>

<p>Hitherto, no distinctly recognisable fossil has been discovered, with
the important exception of the <i>Eozoön Canadense</i>, which has been pronounced
to have been a gigantic foraminifer, growing layer upon layer,
and thus forming reefs of limestone; the subject, however, is still a matter

Canada.</p>

<p>Granite was at one time considered to be the true primitive rock.
Gneiss is a word of Saxon origin, and consists of the same materials as
granite in different proportions. Mica-schist
is made up of two of the same
constituents as the granite and gneiss.
They are without fossil traces.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cambrian</span> system of aqueous
origin may be said to contain evidence
of the dawn of organic life. It is part
of the clay-slate system, and the term
“Cambrian” is taken from the ancient
name of Wales, where slate is plentiful.
Mica-slate is also very important. These
Cambrian rocks are of the next oldest formation to the Laurentian, and all
the various deposits may be examined in Wales, where also traces of volcanic
and ice action may readily be perceived. In the pass of Llanberis one
immense ice-borne block is very prominent; no agency but ice could
have put it there as it rests. It is estimated that the Cambrian and
“Lower” Silurian rocks are from 20,000 to 30,000 feet in thickness,
and must embrace a very lengthened period. The fossils of these formations
show that zoophytes and certain primitive crustacea lived in the
remote ages when these rocks were formed by sedimentary deposition.
We have scarce a trace of plant-life. The organic remains include annular
worms, the first arrangement of the articulated animals according to Cuvier.
The flora and fauna are, of course, very low in the scale of creation, when
land and sea were so differently arranged.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Silurian</span> system was so named by
Sir. R. Murchison, after the territory formerly
occupied by the Silures, but the system is, of
course, universal. We have here sandstones,
limestones, and shales, deposits lying upon the
Welsh slate. The Upper and Lower Ludlow
beds, and the “May Hill” sandstone, then the
Lower Silurian, with Caradoc beds, and the
Tremadoc slate, etc. In this system volcanic action is observable, and all
the organic remains are those of marine animals, such as corals, shell-fish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
marine worms, encrinites, molluscs, and other zoophytes in great variety.
We find also a number of graptolites, trilobites, echinus (sea-urchin),
terebratula, and many other forms.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<div class="caption">Fig. 654.—Terebratula.</div>
</div>

<p>The Trilobites were amongst the first creatures inhabiting our globe,
and it is a curious fact to
contemplate, that their eyes
(fig. 655) should have been
preserved perfect; they present
one of those wonderful
objects which carry one’s
thoughts backwards to the
early ages of the world, probably many millions of years,
and yet it is found by the peculiar structure of the eyes of
these Trilobites that they were placed at the bottom of the
sea with perfect power to look upwards at the light of the sun through the
transparent waters. The same hand and the same power had then Divine care
and solicitude for the well-being of His creatures, as great as He has for those
of later ages, and these animals are mentioned in Genesis—“Let the waters
bring forth abundantly the moving creature
that hath life.”</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_576c.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 655.—Eye of Trilobite.</div>
</div>

<p>Thus we see that ages of comparative
quiet succeeded the first great contraction of
the earth’s crust, probably millions of years,
during which time the tides and currents of
the ocean had to wash and wear down all
the thousands of projecting rocks or inequalities,
and dissolve (as before described) all the lime, depositing the sand
and clay in those immense strata which form the old-named “transition
series”; this appears to have taken place over nearly the whole world at
that time, and ages upon ages must have elapsed to form such deposits
as the sandstone, claystone, and
limestone, in alternation, forming the
“Llandilo,” “Caradoc,” and “Wenlock”
strata, more than a mile in
thickness; these are by some geologists
reckoned among the primary
series (by some called the “transition
rocks”), and in England form
the “Cambrian” and “Silurian” systems
which are so rich in minerals
and metallic veins.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Old Red Sandstone</span>, or
<span class="smcap">Devonian</span> System, is the next of the
series of layers which built up our earth, but a great gap of years separates
it from the Silurian. We find the “Old Red” in the Mendips and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
Scotland. The rocks in the West of England are apparently of later
deposition and of marine origin, while the “Old Red” is apparently a
fresh-water deposit. It is very “arenaceous,” and owes its tint chiefly to
iron, although there are circumstances in which it appears neither as a
sandstone nor with a red colour; but red sandstone describes the true formation
very accurately.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_577.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig 657.—Graptolites.</div>
</div>

<p>In this water-deposited system, whether in lakes or by the sea, we find
a considerable advance upon the Silurian. We have flora in more variety—seaweeds
and ferns. The remains are all aquatic. We have nothing higher
in the scale of creation than the fish, the first vertebrates; and judging by
varieties a very considerable time must have elapsed during which the Old
Red Sandstone was deposited. The dipterus—or double-winged—is
herewith shown as an example of the fossil fish of the Old Red Sandstone
period.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_577b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 658.—“Double-winged” Fish.</div>
</div>

<p>It is curious that no remains of any land-inhabiting animals have been
discovered in this system—whether in the Old Red or the Devonian
formations (the Lower and Upper Red Sandstones). We can only
distinguish the remains of aquatic animals or plants. We may picture the
great cuttle-fish, the nautilus, and the dipterus, with various orders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
mollusca, and the gradual approach to the crustacea, but no terrestrial
animals have been discovered. We may take it for granted then that the
Old Red Sandstone and Devonian systems are different—the former being
found in Scotland and parts of England, and formed of deposits in fresh or
brackish water, while in the Devonian system the marine deposits are corals,
and all the indications of ocean life, separated from the great inland lakes
by a range of hills. Neither of the terms (Old Red Sandstone or Devonian)
limit geographically or descriptively the formations of this system. All the
rocks are clearly distributed between the Silurian and the Carboniferous.
The invertebrates in this last system have not developed very much, but corals
are very abundant, and fish of some armoured species are plentiful and
curious, while the crustacea were enormous.</p>

<p>We now arrive at the most important of all the rock formations, the
one to which we owe our national prosperity—we mean the <span class="smcap">Coal</span> System.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Carboniferous Formation.</span></p>

<p>While the foregoing depositions were being made the earth was still
undergoing changes. The sandstones were deposited, and the corals making
use of the lime carried into the waters began to build and form masses of
limestone under the sea, pushing back the water and changing the forms
and positions of land and water. All this went on apparently very quietly—volcanic
action was not very frequent—the water was warm. But sometimes
earthquakes would heave up the submarine formations into mountains, and
therefore we find the fossils of the tiny sea-animals on the hills. Extensive
swamps were formed by partially retreating sea-water, and their vegetation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
became luxuriant. Tree ferns and all the floral appearance of the tropics
grew up and formed dense
forests, far thicker than any
we know of at the present
time. It will readily be
understood that the condition
of the atmosphere must
have been particularly favourable
to the growth of
plants, and therefore not suitable
for air-breathing animals.
Heat and carbonic acid must
have been greatly developed.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_579a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 660.—Tree Ferns.</div>
</div>

<p>We can now perceive
how the gradual filling up of
the earth for man’s reception
was taking place. The
rain was taking carbonic acid from the air, for the dead plants gave it out
in enormous volumes. The carbonate of lime dissolved in the water-springs,
etc., was carried to the sea for polypi to build shells from.
The trees were absorbing carbonic acid, too, and while purifying the
air, were retaining the carbon in their stems and leaves and branches, which
(when they decayed) remained untouched, and accumulated in thick layers
to sink down, and by pressure be turned into coal. This great effect was
carried out several times; and it is a remarkable fact that we find coal,
limestone, and ironstone so near together, all useful to us and to each other
in the course of the working of the minerals—so we come to the Carboniferous
system.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_579b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> Fig. 661.—Limestone made up of corals (<i>Favosites polymorpha</i>).</div>
</div>

<p>Coal we have already treated of in <cite>Mineralogy</cite>, and coal looks at times
very different from our preconceived ideas of a <em>sedimentary</em> rock, which we
know is regularly deposited in layers.
But when we split or break the coal we
find its cleavage in a certain direction.
Coal is wood squeezed and petrified by
ages between enormous layers of sedimentary
rocks, and the coal-seam rests
upon the soil in which the plants once
grew—perhaps more than six hundred
thousand years ago!</p>

<p>Of course coal, as we burn it, was
not all made at once. We can trace it
from the swamp as Peat, on to “Lignite,”
or woody coal, through the Tertiary and
New Red Sandstone to the coal measures themselves. Even lower down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
we find the remains in more or less pure carbon forms—the anthracite
and the graphite of the primary formations.</p>

<p>Coal appears not to have been formed equally in all places during the
period in which it originated. The remains of plants found in these strata
lead us to infer, that, during that period there existed an exceedingly
vigorous and crowded vegetation, consisting principally of tree ferns and
equisetaceæ, of which the <i>Sphenopteris Hœninghausii</i> (fig. 662), <i>Pecopteris
aquilina</i> (fig. 663), and <i>Neuropteris Loshii</i> (fig. 664), are amongst the most
beautiful that have been found, and the flora and fauna of this period were of
a more or less primitive kind or low order, but very luxurious. The former
display a decided advance, and reptiles of aquatic forms appear with large
and predaceous fishes. Mountain limestone, which is usually found in the
coal formations, includes metallic deposits, and organic remains are very
abundant in it. The following are specimens of the fossils—</p>

</div>

<p>The Carboniferous system is a very important one, as may be seen. In
these beds we have coal, limestone, sandstone, and shale. The <em>Coal
Measures</em> consist of grit and sandstone and shale, with coal seams. The
Carboniferous Limestone, or “Mountain” Limestone, has no coal in it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
sandstone has been termed “Millstone Grit,” because millstones are made
from it. We then have limestone
shales, and the sandstone beds. Each
coal seam indicates a subsidence of the
land and a regular series of underclay
or soil in which the plants grew,—the
plants themselves,—iron, coal,
and then the shale, and so on again,
indicating frequent changes and a long
lapse of ages.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 666.—Fern (<i>Pecopteris ligata</i>) from upper shale,

</div>

<p>These “Coal Measures” occupy
an area of five hundred square miles in
Great Britain alone; and as we have
already said, the period which elapsed
while these deposits were being laid
down represents hundreds of thousands of years. The deposit would increase
at the rate of about three feet in a thousand years. And this is only one
period of the many changes to which our world has been subjected since it
first began its revolution in space around the sun.</p>

<p>Coal is usually found in “basins” or depressions—a sort of trough
owing to the upheaval of surrounding strata which became in time denuded
(or washed away) with any coal that was there. So it is in places where it
is concealed by overlying beds that protect it, that we now find the coal saved
from disturbance. When we search and come upon red sandstone and
grey-wacke, we may be almost certain that we are near coal, particularly if
the surrounding rocks form a “basin.”</p>

<p>We have now briefly sketched the Carboniferous system, for in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
recreations we can do little more. We shall find in many places in England
tree trunks in the sandy shore, and ample evidence that a forest has been at
one time submerged in that spot. So inland the land sank down again and
again in successive periods—water, mud, soil, vegetable growth succeeded, to
be again submerged and form a new coal seam for the use of man, who was
destined to appear after the lapse of ages.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_582.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 669.—Impressions of feet of Cheirotherium.</div>
</div>

<p>At length the land remained undisturbed. It sank no more, and the
trees waved luxuriously over the buried forests of past ages, and another
cycle set in called the <span class="smcap">Permian</span>, from the ancient kingdom of Permia, where
all the features of that period are exhibited on a very grand scale, and which
extended for several hundred miles between the Ural mountains and the
Volga. In the Permian period we have the progression of animal life more
distinctly developed than in the Carboniferous system, which immediately
preceded it. It is true there are indications in the latter that curious animals,
called the Cheirotherium and the Labyrinthodon, were alive then, and the
remains of numerous insects, such as beetles and crickets, have been found;
but the Permian developed them, and reptiles, saurians, and lizards have
been traced; but as Sir R. Murchison states, throughout the whole extent
the animals are of a single type. We have the hand-like impressions of the
feet of the Cheirotherium, so called from the Greek “cheir,” a hand. The
soil appears to have been very soft, and peculiarly adapted to receive
impressions, and which having been in many places covered over with a
stratum of fine sand, and then abandoned by the sea, the whole has hardened
into stone, and being now separated, the one contains their footprints, and
the other perfect casts of them! Nor are these footmarks all that these
sandstones have to tell us of their day; for the ripples of the waves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
even the little pits made by drops of rain as they fell, are in this most
marvellous manner preserved, forming objects of wonder and admiration.</p>

<p>The organic remains during this period are not very abundant, and
many of the fauna of the previous systems appear to have died out, while
others appeared to meet with fuller development in succeeding ages. The
Permian is also known as the New Red Sandstone, or Magnesian Limestone
group. “Dias” has also been suggested with reference to the “Trias” group,
“the Upper New Red Sandstone,” which comes next. The Permian rocks
are very varied, and contain minerals, such as copper and sulphur.</p>

<p>As the strata below the new sandstone formation was called the “Carboniferous”
system, from its containing much carbon in the form both of
coal and carbonic acid, so this has been called the “Saliferous” system, from
the occurrence in many places of strata of “rock-salt,” or crystallised chloride
of sodium, and (where the rain finds its way down and dissolves it) of brine
springs; these (in England) exist chiefly in Cheshire and Warwickshire, but
in Poland and Hungary they exist on a much larger scale, the rock-salt
being nearly a thousand feet thick. It has been said that these strata of
salt were formed by the evaporation of salt lakes, but it is much more
probable that salt is one of the natural materials of the earth, and that both
salt lakes and oceans have become salt from dissolving out these strata
wherever they have come into contact.</p>

<p>It is supposed that during the Permian period the greater portion of
the continent of Europe was raised above the ocean, and the deposits were
formed in salt lakes, for the appearance of the organic remains tends to
establish the fact that the creatures of that period were not far from dry
land even in their watery existence, and the reptiles found confirm this view.
We have now to examine the Mesozoic, or Secondary System.</p>

<p>We trust that the general reader has gleaned from the foregoing chapter
some few ideas concerning the growth of plant and animal life in the early
periods of the world’s existence. From the Laurentian System we have
briefly traced the conformation of the globe at the dawn of organic life
through the Silurian Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous formations,
indicating as we proceeded the chief points in the world’s history, and the
gradual development of life through many ages. There is no real or bold
line of demarcation drawn between these systems. As seam unites to seam,
and layer to layer, stratum upon stratum, so the systems almost insensibly
unite, and forms of life appear, mature, and die away as the babe grows into
the man, and dies away again to old age and final extinction. So one
system merges into another, each and all a factor in the great work which
was intended to prepare the earth for the greatest and latest development
of Nature—<span class="smcap">Man</span>!</p>

<p>But all this while the earth had been, as it still is, undergoing continual
change. Sometimes gradually, in the wearing away, or elevation of beach
or headland; sometimes suddenly, as when mighty hills were upheaved and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
the deeply-laid granite or limestone was lifted to the summits of the
mountains from the depths of the sea. Land and water came and went,
and the ever-changing earth still
brought forth abundantly “the herb
yielding seed after its kind,” and
the “moving things upon the
ground after their kind,” ever improving
and developing till they
culminated in the splendid vegetation
and immense animals of the
Tertiary period, and lay silent afterwards
in the cold grasp of the
great ice age for the thousands of
years of the glacial epoch.</p>

<p>We now enter upon the <span class="smcap">Trias</span>,
or New (Upper) Red Sandstone,
which is divided into Upper and
Lower Trias, “Keuper” and “Bunter.”
We have three principal headings in the Secondary System—the
<span class="smcap">Triassic</span> (the oldest), the <span class="smcap">Oolitic</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Cretaceous</span>. In the first we

in the last, chalk, or white limestone. In some districts there are traces of
volcanic action.</p>

<p>On the top of the “Upper Trias,” or “Keuper” formation, we have the
Lias, which succeeds the Rhætic beds, and in this we find many rich traces
of reptiles and birds which come now before us in the rising scale of creation.
In the seas of this period we
have numerous crustacea, the
nautilus and the cuttle-fish.
The <em>Saurians</em> now come before
our retrospective vision. It is
the “Reptile Age” in all its
development, and the huge
labyrinthodon, the iguanodon,
pterodactyle, and ichthyosaurus
testify to the magnitude
of the fauna of the period.
The first mammal specimen,
a marsupial, has been traced
back to this time; and the
tropical temperature was
favourable for luxuriant vegetation,
pines, and palms.</p>

<p>In the swamps or shallow waters the great reptiles disported themselves,
and seized their prey, the water-fowl, which now appeared in numbers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
of enormous size. Nor were insects absent. Numbers of remains have
been discovered; beetles, dragon-flies, grasshoppers, etc., in multitudes yield
us information, while the marine fossils, star-fish, mollusca, and various
fishes, are of frequent occurrence. Animal and vegetable life during this
period must have been very rich and varied—literally leaving “footprints in
the sands of time.”</p>

<p>The “Blue Lias” is a term familiar to every reader. It is a kind of
limestone mixed with clay, of a blue colour, and upon this we find the
Oolitic, or Oolite System—so called because it somewhat resembles the roe
of a fish. The Lias clays are used for bricks, and Whitby “jet” is also
obtained from the Upper Lias. Jet is really a lignite, or wood in the
process of transmutation. In this Lias formation, besides the numerous
fossil remains already mentioned, we find the “snakestones” (ammonites),
the stone-lily, and belemnites, with many nautili and shells.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Oolite</span>, or <span class="smcap">Jurassic</span>, underlies the chalk, and overlies the Trias
formation. The term “Jurassic” originates from the Jura range, which is
almost entirely composed of Oolitic strata. These strata are greatly distorted
by pressure, and when we reach Switzerland and the familiar Alps,
we find gneiss, crystalline, limestones, and schists, into which the Oolite has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>

for ornaments. The Coral Rag and Oxford clay are rich in fossils, and the
former, as its name implies, is composed of ancient coral reef. The Portland
beds produce the well-known building stone. The Purbecks, of which there
are three divisions, appear to have been deposited in fresh water, and occur
in Dorsetshire.</p>

<p>All the Oolite strata supply organic remains. We have plants and
ferns, reptiles, and a number of new genera of conchifera and cephalopods,
star-fish, urchins, and the enormous bats, and the terrible megalosaurus, and
the cetiosaurus, steneosaurus, and pliosaurus, of enormous size. One very
remarkable bird has been found in the Bavarian limestone of this period;
it is called the Archæopteryx, which is described as having a leg-bone and
foot like the familiar birds, but the tail is lizard-like, with feathers springing
from each joint. Sponges, corals, and fish, and many other forms of animal
life are found in the Oolites. The reptiles must have had it all their own
way in this period, for there were both carnivorous and vegetable feeders,
and teeth of the pliosaurus have been found which measure fifteen inches,
the jaws being six feet long. We have seen that corals must have built
up their reefs in the waters, which then overlaid the land we call the United
Kingdom.</p>

<p>There must have been great changes during this period, and the strata
are chiefly marine. The Wealden formations are the exceptions, and in
the fresh-water deposits insect forms abound. The appearance and variety
of animal and vegetable life must have been curious and interesting.</p>

<p>The Weald or “Wold” of Kent is often spoken of, and it extends with
the Surrey and Sussex Wealden formations for some distance. The strata
are of fresh-water deposition, differing in this from the chalk, although the
Wealden beds are included in the Cretaceous Group, which is composed as
follows:—</p>

<p>The “Wealden” formation is divided into Hastings sand and Weald
clay. The former consists of clay and sandy beds, and is observable at
Hastings, and in the neighbourhood of Tunbridge. The Weald clay consists
of blue and brown clays, with sandstone, and the limestone known as
“Sussex Marble,” which is formed by the <em>paludina</em> of the rivers. There is
another division often seen in Dorsetshire, and called the Punfield beds,
which partake both of marine and fresh-water remains, which are distinct in
the true Wealden and cretaceous formations, the former being of fresh, and
the latter of salt-water origin.</p>

<p>The remains of enormous reptiles are numerous in the Wealden formations;
crocodiles, lizards, turtles of gigantic size have been discovered,
and most curious fossils have been disinterred
in the Hastings district. The “Greensands”
are separated by what is termed gault, a stiff
blue clay found in Norfolk, Essex, and Kent.
The Lower Greensand includes the well-known
Kentish rag, or limestone, of which so many
churches are built. The Upper Greensand is
supposed to be a seashore deposit on the sides
of an extensive ocean or sea, at the bottom
of which the chalk was formed. After the
Wealden beds were formed, they were covered
by these greensand estuary-beds, or littoral
strata. In these series new forms of life appeared,
and the waters became the receptacle of myriads of mollusca, etc., which
in time formed the great chalk cliffs and downs so often referred to. The
chalk is interstratified with sand, which as “gault” and “greensand” was
probably the sand of the ocean bed before the
chalk was formed upon it, and the seas must have
supported many marine reptiles, for stony “nodules,”
or coprolites, which are the fossil excreta of the
animals, are found, and now used for manure, after
being buried for thousands of years. Examination
of these remains has resulted in the discovery of the
teeth and bones of fish which had been devoured by
the gigantic reptiles. An illustration of a shell thus discovered is annexed.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 678.—Ammonite from the chalk.</div>
</div>

<p>We have in a former chapter spoken
of the chalk and its formation. We
know that it is composed of the minute
foraminifera. The fossil remains are very
numerous in chalk and all of a marine
kind, such as the ammonites, belemnites,
and such cephalopods, and the echinus,
bivalve mollusca, crustacea, etc. We
have occasionally flints appearing in the
chalk, and this circumstance has given
rise to some speculation as to how the
flints got there, for they consist of nearly
pure silica; and the theory of the
petrifaction of sponges, madrepores, etc., has been started to account for their
presence. Dr. Carpenter says: “It may be stated, as a fact beyond all
question, that nodular flint and other analogous concretions (such as agates)
may generally be considered as fossilised sponges or alcyonian zoophytes,
since not only are their external forms and their superficial markings often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
highly characteristic of those organisms, but when sections of them are made
sufficiently thin to be transparent, a spongy texture may be most distinctly
recognised in their interior.”</p>

<p>It is now generally admitted that the decaying animal matter acts upon
the silicious spiculæ of sponges, etc., and the silica is thus deposited.</p>

<p>We may then surmise that at some very distant period the whole
extent of the British Isles was submerged, as well as portions of the continent,
and after the strata had been deposited the sea and land were disturbed by
volcanic action. While the secondary strata were being deposited, very little
relative alteration took place, as the deposits are seen to lie “conformably.”
But when the great convulsion which upheaved the Apennines occurred, the
chalk was raised as we find it in the cliffs and downs, which were the beds
of seas. This is the last of the great convulsions which the earth has
undergone, for the tertiary strata, which afterwards began to be deposited,
rest in the hollows or basins (chiefly in the chalk) then left; the alterations
in and since these deposits appear to consist chiefly of the upheaval of certain
localities, the depression of others, the evaporation of inland lakes, and the
wear and tear of the land from these causes, which are still in continuous
action (as from the washing down of cliffs by the sea, and the formation of
mud deposits at the mouths of rivers), or the volcanic agencies which in
some places (as in Ireland) have cast up basalt over the chalk.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_590.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 679.—Mosasaurus (Maestricht).</div>
</div>

<p>There is a sort of transition formation which is classed with the
Cretaceous System, and termed “Maestricht,” after the town in Belgium. It
appears that this is an upper chalk layer, an intermediary between the
Secondary and Tertiary, and here on the banks of the Meuse we find the
Mosasaurus, the “lizard of the Meuse,” of whose remains we give specimens
in the illustration. This transition chalk—as we may call it to distinguish
it—must have been laid down at a later period than the flinty chalk, and we
find it in many places. It serves therefore as a fitting introduction to the
Tertiary Period of Geological time.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Tertiary Period.</span></p>

<p>We now enter upon a period when the animal creation attained its
greatest development, the “Age of Mammals”; for they were then the
kings of creation. The Tertiary Period is divided into three stages, viz.—</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eocene</span>, or the Dawning of the now <em>existing</em> creation.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Miocene</span>, or the Middle, or “minority” of existing creation.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Pliocene</span>, or the Recent, or still more developed period.</p>

<p>We will glance at them in that order, which Sir C. Lyell introduced.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_591.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 680.—Skull of the Dinotherium.</div>
</div>

<p>The Eocene formation is shown in what is termed the “London Basin,”
here illustrated by a section in which we find soft sands without fossils
(Thanet Beds), and a kindred kind in Surrey, in which fossils (marine) are
found. After these we get the “Reading and Woolwich” beds as we
ascend. These are of clay and pebbles, etc., with river fossils. The
Oldhaven beds are included on the map; they occur towards Blackheath
and Herne Bay. The London clay is very stiff, and in some places blue.
It is full of fossils of birds, beasts, fruits, and vegetables, trees, reptiles, and
fish, and the variety of the organic remains appears to indicate the fact that
at one time the Thames flowed through swampy ground to the sea, in which
dwelt, in a warm climate, immense mammalia, such as the megatherium,
glyptodon, tapir, etc., and some turtles of enormous size.</p>

<p>It is also on record from late observations that these immense animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
were even mixed up, and almost fabulous creatures inhabited the land where
England now is. We read of antelope-horses, lion-like bears, and camel-stags.
The vegetation was then of a tropical kind, and in the deep forests
and jungles these enormous animals—the mammoth dinotherium, and such
species—roamed and plunged in the swamps at the mouth of the Thames.
At length these types died away, and gave place to the elephant and the
hippopotamus, and the climate by degrees became less warm, and still slowly
decreased in temperature.</p>

<p>A glance at Sir C. Lyell’s “Principles of Geology” will show us how,
as we examine the more modern strata, we find a great increase in the
European lands, which may have been compensated by the submersion of
the Pacific islands. During the period of the vegetation of the Secondary
epochs, our climate (between the lias and the chalk) was favourable to a
tropical growth. Enormous rivers flowed through our islands, and gigantic
crocodiles, etc., with flying reptiles, were masters of the land. There were
numerous fishes, but the reptiles did not appear in such very great numbers.</p>

<p>These large and elephantine animals must have existed while the
climate of Northern Europe underwent some very considerable changes. We
read of the woolly rhinoceros, and the hairy elephant, or mastodon, which
has been found in Siberia. Reindeer appeared in England, and we know
now that these animals inhabit cold countries. The mountains were considerably
elevated during the latter Tertiary period; snow fell and ice
formed upon the summits of the mountains, while glaciers crept down the
sides. The warm, almost tropical climate of the prior ages was gradually
but surely giving way to the Ice Age; the earth was slowly dipping, and the
sun’s rays had less power.</p>

<p>Professor Ramsay says the “assemblage of fossils found in the London
clay point to the fact that the whole of these strata were deposited in the
estuary of a great continental river comparable to the Amazon and the
Ganges. The palm-nuts and the host of other plants help to prove it, and
the remains of river tortoises, crocodiles, snakes, marsupials, and several
tapir-like mammals, all point in the same direction. The estuarine conditions
begun during the deposit of the Woolwich and Reading beds were
still going on when the London clay was thrown down; with this difference,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>
that by sinking of the area the estuary had become longer, wider, and
deeper, but still remained connected with a vast continent, through which
the Eocene river flowed.”</p>

<p>The Miocene deposits
are not so generally important
in the United Kingdom,
but in America very valuable
fossils have been discovered
in these strata. The Pliocene
strata extend along the east
of Great Britain, where they
are denominated “Crag,” as
Norfolk Crag, Red Crag,
Coralline Crag. Underneath
these mammalian remains
have been discovered. After
the Pliocene we come to the
Post-Pliocene, which really
closes the long Tertiary period. During these ages the gradual development
of created beings apparently reached its height. It was towards the end of the
Middle Eocene that the great mountain chain of Europe came into existence,
which is connected, as any casual observer may see, with the Himalaya. In
fact, the whole chain, from the Thibetian range through India, the Caucasus,
Alps, and Pyrenees, is continuous, and formed of the same material (“nummulitic
limestone”). There is no doubt that the whole northern hemisphere
enjoyed at the commencement of the Tertiary period a warm, not to say
tropical, climate, which got colder and colder.</p>

<p>We find the increase of animals and plants more fitted to the requirements
of man and our present climate. There are many signs of the
successive increase of land in Europe generally, while the contrast the
Tertiary period bears to the Secondary is very marked. In the former we
have extensive deposits in the waters of wide, open seas; in the latter the
depositions were evidently made where dry land, with its accompanying
bays and lakes, were extensive and
numerous. The former is marine,
the latter lacustrine and marine.
The seas of the Tertiary period have
lately been defined.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 683.—Megatherium cuvieri (<i>post-Pliocene</i>), S. America.</div>
</div>

<p>Sir Charles Lyell, in his
“Principles of Geology,” shows us
this, and defines the European features
at the commencement of the
Tertiary epoch. At that time, the
British islands, with the exception of the basins of London, the Isle of
Wight, and Norfolk, had wholly emerged from the deep. But a third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
part of France was still under water. Italy consisted only of a long
and narrow ridgy peninsula, branching off from the Alps near Savona.
Turkey and Greece, south of the Danube, were laid dry; and a tract of land
extended from the Vosges, through central Germany, Bohemia, and the
north of Hungary, perhaps to the Balkan. But the whole of the north of
Europe and Asia, from Holland eastward to central Tartary, and from
Saxony and the Carpathians northward to Sweden, Lapland, and the Ural
chain, lay beneath the ocean. The same subterranean movements, which
have subsequently raised the wide plains of our northern continents above
the sea-level, have given great additional elevation to the then existing
land. Thus the Alps have certainly acquired an increased height of from
two thousand to four thousand feet since the commencement of the Tertiary
period. The Pyrenees, whose highest ridge consists of marine calcareous
beds, of the age of our chalk
and greensand series, while the
Tertiary strata at their foot are
horizontal, and reach only the
height of a few hundred feet
above the sea, seem to have
been entirely upheaved in the
comparatively brief interval between the deposition
of the chalk and these Tertiary strata.
The Jura, also, owe a great part of their
present elevation to convulsions which happened
after the deposition of the Tertiary
groups. On the other hand, it is possible
that some mountain-chains may have been
lowered by subsidence, as well as by meteoric
degradation, during the same series of ages
in this quarter of the globe; and on some
points shallows may have been depressed
into deep abysses. But, on the whole, everything tends to show that
the great predominance of land which now distinguishes the northern
hemisphere has been brought about only at a recent period, and Sir
Charles holds that the shifting of the continents is sufficient to account
for the variations of climate. We have every reason to believe that before
the Glacial epoch England and the Continent were united, and during the
Glacial period England and North America were joined, viâ Greenland and
Ireland. Mr. Dawkins says that England at that time was six hundred feet
above its present level. If so—and we cannot question his conclusions—the
Channel was then dry.</p>

<p>The “Great Ice Age” then came upon the world. For the information
of readers who wish to peruse the whole history of this epoch and its causes,
we may add that in Professor Geikie’s most interesting work, they will find
full details. We can only refer to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span></p>

<p>The gradual decrease of temperature upon the earth, which was the
cause of the Glacial period extending over the north of Europe, has been
attributed to the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit; and here astronomy steps
in to our assistance. We have read in the chapters on Astronomy, how the
movement of the earth, like a top near the end of its “spin,” causes the
“precession of the equinoxes,” and in connection with this phenomenon the
earth’s orbit becomes more and more circular at certain periods of thousands
of years, and goes away from the sun. We therefore receive the light and
heat at a greater angle. Consequently, less heat is received, and ice is
formed, as at the North and South Poles at present.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_595.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 685.—Drift Ice.</div>
</div>

<p>Doctor Croll has pointed out that the great eccentricity of the earth’s
orbit existed about 210,000 years ago, when there was a difference between
the nearest and farthest position of the earth and the sun of 12,000,000 of
miles at least.<a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> This is a very considerable distance even in the enormous
spaces which intervene between us and the other planets of the solar system,
and about that time the Glacial period arrived. Perhaps we may make this
clearer by going back to the precession of the equinoxes.</p>

<p>The earth moves in an orbit called an ellipse, and the sun is not in the
centre of this nearly circular path. We can now understand that the earth
comes nearer to the sun sometimes and recedes at others. These points of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
nearest approach and greatest distance are termed <em>perihelion</em> and <em>aphelion</em>.
In the latter case we are about 9,000,000 of miles farther from the sun than
when in perihelion—that is, when the greatest “eccentricity” is reached. In
addition to this the axis of the earth is continually changing in direction by
reason of solar attraction at the equator. This shifting, as explained in the
astronomical section, is very slight every year, and in the course of 24,000
years the conditions of the seasons will have completely changed round and
back again,—for the northern and southern conditions will be reversed in
our hemisphere. Day and night come twenty minutes earlier every year.
We are now nearer the sun in winter as shown in diagram (page 497); when
we change we shall be nearest the sun in summer and farthest in winter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_596.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 686.—The Mer de Glace.</div>
</div>

<p>Doctor Croll, who has done much in his most interesting paper on
changes of climate<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>, tells us how this eccentricity of the earth’s orbit produced
indirectly the Glacial epoch. He shows how, if in a period of the greatest
“eccentricity” our winter came in aphelion, we should receive one-fifth less
heat than now, but a correspondingly greater heat in summer. But if our
winter under such circumstances fall (as now) in perihelion, the difference
between winter and summer would be practically <em>nil</em>, because the sun during
a period of the earth’s great eccentricity “could not warm the hemisphere
whose summer happened to arrive in perihelion.” No doubt the sun’s rays
would be very powerful, but the earth being covered with ice and snow
could not be warmed; fogs would accrue and hide the sun, as at present in
Antarctic summers, when the cold is very great. The warm ocean currents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
would be stopped, and the northern portion of our hemisphere would be, as
it undoubtedly was, frozen over and covered with snow.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_597.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 687.—Mammoth and Irish Elk.</div>
</div>

<p>When we consider the millions of years since the earth is supposed to
have been launched into space, we can imagine that the Glacial periods would
occur frequently, and considering the very slow “precession” movement
there, and the alternating tropical climate with graduations of temperature
for thousands of years they would last long. The great Glacial period is
computed to have begun 240,000 years ago and lasted 160,000 years with
alternations of comparative summer; and so the years went on, season
succeeding season, altering the appearance of the earth, and causing successive
changes in the distribution of animal and vegetable life. Then the
great mammalia, the mammoth and hippopotamus, with the hyæna, lion,
and other felidæ came, and went when Arctic animals usurped their places.
At the later Glacial epoch man must have arrived in Britain, and “this
being so,” says Professor Geikie, “it is startling to recall in imagination those
grand geological revolutions of which he must have been a witness.... He
entered Britain at a time when our country was joined to Europe across the
bed of the German Ocean; at a time when the winters were still severe
enough to freeze over the rivers in the south of England; at a time when
glaciers nestled in our upland and mountain valleys, and the Arctic
mammalia occupied the land. He lived here long enough to witness a
complete change of climate, to see the Arctic mammalia vanish from
England, and the hippopotamus and its congeners take their places. At
a later date, and while a mild and genial climate still continued, he beheld
the sea slowly gain upon the land, until, little by little, step by step, a large
portion of our country was submerged—a submergence which, as we know,
reached in Wales to the extent of 1,300 feet or thereabouts.”</p>

<p>We find that the land underwent many subsequent changes; it rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>
from the sea, was again covered with ice, and many parts of Europe were
devastated by immense glaciers—that of the Rhone extending for more than
two hundred miles. Then came vegetation as the ice gave way, and
luxuriance of the tropics reigned; more cold after that, then more heat, till
the ice was finally driven to its mountain fastnesses, and “Britain for the
last time became continental. Neolithic man came upon the scene; his
palæolithic predecessor had, as far as Britain and northern Europe are concerned,
vanished for ever.” The inquiry respecting the arrival and presence
of man in Britain would lead us too far in pursuit. The fact has been
established that man was living in the Thames valley while tropical animals
were in the country, and he has been classed by Professor Boyd-Dawkins
amongst the mid-pleistocene mammalia, and at that distant period, man as
man, and not as an intermediate form connecting the human race with the
lower animals, was present in Europe.</p>

<p>The stone implements which have been found in river beds and in
caverns, associated with the bones of various animals, such as the elephant,
rhinoceros, hyæna, bear, and others prove this. These very ancient and rudely-fashioned
implements have been divided into two classes, the Palæolithic
and the Neolithic, by Sir John Lubbock. First the stone implements were
used, and stone was superseded by bronze and iron. Then we come to the
historic period. In the neolithic period we find stone implements in the
lake dwellings of Switzerland and Constance (as well as the Lake of
Neuchatel), all of which have lately developed many treasures. Bronze tools
have also been found, and so the gradual progress of man as a fashioner of
weapons can be traced from age to age.</p>

<p>From the “river-drift” man we descend to the cave-man, who is
supposed to have been identical with the Esquimaux. When Britain
became an island the cave-man seems to have disappeared from our
country, and in the prehistoric age the earliest of the present inhabitants
came here, and brought with them domestic animals; then the Celts of
the bronze age, and then the iron. The wild beasts gradually disappeared,
and domestic ones occupied their places under civilized conditions.<a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>So we come from the “Glacial period” to the open door of history
through the antechamber of the prehistoric time.</p>

<p>The prehistoric is the arbitrary division between the post-pliocene or
pleistocene and the known “historic” periods of the world’s history, and
we must dismiss it with a few general remarks, for the changes which we
have attempted to follow are still taking place in the earth; volcanoes and
earthquakes are unsettling the strata, and adding to the physical and
geographical record which will some day have to be written by posterity
and future geologists. We can see in those prehistoric times traces of men
(hunters and fishers) existing with difficulty, mayhap, in the midst of
enormous quadrupeds, and fighting for existence with the bears and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>
other formidable foes. We have noticed the stone ages, the rough and
the smooth as they may be called, and we can picture the primitive
agriculture and work of the neolithic man. But it is by no means to
be believed that neolithic man in Britain was a race all over the world.
We may assume that in eastern climes the human race were in a more
civilized condition as improvements made their way slowly westward. Our
island history commences in the time of Julius Cæsar. Eastern chronicles
go back many thousands of years farther.</p>

<p>It is so short a time, geologically speaking, since man appeared within
the limits of history, that the earth’s changes, except from direct volcanic
action or water erosion, are very trifling. The change is, as we said, continually
proceeding; ceaselessly the earth is wearing away, and depositing
her riches where she is undisturbed by civilization and man’s excavations
and intrusions. The rock is worn by water; the grit is carried down and
deposited to form sedimentary rocks as of old; the lime will continue to
assist the coral to be built up; and the chalk cliffs will be born under the
sea, and our organic remains shall be found to tell remote ages that we
were an enlightened people. For all we can tell, and it is by no means
unlikely another recurring cycle of Arctic and Tropical periods will in time
pass over our earth; the bear and reindeer, the hippopotamus and the
rhinoceros, may again inhabit our islands. If our generation be destroyed,
the purely animal creation with the vegetable world will reign over the
land, and new forests will deposit new coal measures for the support and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>
comfort of a new generation of highly organized beings, when our remains
shall have passed away to the borders of a “prehistoric” age.</p>

<p>We have seen in the foregoing brief sketch how the world has arrived
at its present beautiful condition,—how it has been step by step prepared
for us, how nature’s forces have been and are still working according to
the immutable laws of the Universe. And, after all, how little we know!
What scraps of intelligence only are we able to gather up from the
boundless quantity of material which must have been laid down, yet what
wondrous results scientists have been able to adduce from even these
comparatively scanty specimens! The sea and land are ever telling us
the same old story. Man’s research and Bible teaching are found hand in
hand in cordial and reverent agreement. Nothing is altered since the day
that the Divine command, “Let there be light,” went forth into space, and
till the earth be destroyed the same forces will continue in operation, guided
by the Hand that made it—“ever faithful, ever sure.”</p>

<small>PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY.</small></h2>

<p class="hang">IGNEOUS ROCKS—LAND AND WATER—SPRINGS, WELLS, AND GEYSERS—SNOW
AND ICE—THEIR EFFECTS.</p>


<p>In the foregoing pages we have chiefly considered the stratified rocks, but
we are now approaching another branch of our subject—viz., “Physiography,”
which, as distinguished from the usual so-called Physical Geography, will
deal with the phenomena of the earth, air, and water, thus leading us to
Meteorology as a conclusion.</p>

<p>We have arrived at a certain knowledge concerning the Earth as a
planet, her place in the universe, and the composition of the “Crust,” as it
is termed. We have examined the stratified rocks, which include sand and
gravel, stones, and boulders equally. To a geologist they are all “rocks.”
We must now examine the igneous rocks, which bear an important part in
the structure of the Earth, whose surface we have now more minutely to
examine. It has already been stated (p. 571) that igneous rocks have been
upheaved while in a state of fusion—that is, while in a melted condition.
These igneous, or fire-produced rocks, are divided into classes, just as the
unstratified rocks are, and the divisions are called the <span class="smcap">Volcanic</span> and
<span class="smcap">Plutonic</span>, including “Basic” and “Acidic,” according as they are possessed
of less silica or more.</p>

<p>Sometimes the igneous rocks are classed as volcanic, trappean (from
<i lang="la">trappa</i>, a stair, such as in the Giant’s Causeway), and granitic. The volcanic
in such case being the modern or upper rocks, such as lava, scoria, etc., which,
having been cast up by volcanoes, are of comparatively recent formation.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Volcanic</span> rocks, then, are of recent date, <em>comparatively</em> speaking;
they form the constituent portions of the volcanoes of the present day, and
are found as basaltic formations. They are traced as far back as the
Tertiary period of the globe. Amongst the volcanic rocks we find basalt,
augite, porphyry, serpentine, pumice, pitchstone, felspar, etc. But no
doubt volcanic action has been going on ever since the beginning of the
world as it is now, and will continue to do. It is somewhat curious that
the very old igneous rocks should not be more evident.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Plutonic</span> rocks do not differ essentially from the foregoing.
There is less quartz and more hornblende; and if the ages during which
these formations have been existent in the earth-depths after they became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
solidified be considered, the differences will be fully accounted for. The
greenstones and syenites are prominent amongst the plutonic series.</p>

<p>These plutonic and volcanic rocks are separated into basic and acidic,
as already remarked, but the line cannot be drawn very distinctly. Granite is
the chief plutonic (acidic) rock, and we frequently find it forced upwards into
other strata, its essentially eruptive character being thus decided. That
granite must have taken an immense time to solidify and crystallize is evident,
for no new granites are ever found. We find granite in all the <em>old</em> mountain
chains—such as the Grampians
in Scotland, and the Wicklow
mountains. Our chief European
(active) volcanoes are, so
to speak, modern, as may be
supposed when their constituents
are known. It may be
said that granite was first deposited
as sediment heated by
subterranean fire, and forced
up by thermal action of water
to the mountains, where it is
uncovered by a slow process of
denudation and surface washings
of the earth.</p>

<p>Now without at present
going any farther into the causes
of volcanoes we can see at a
glance that the eruption of the
igneous rocks must have created
a marked and essential difference
in the physical geography
of the globe. It is to these eruptions
that the dislocation and
disturbance of the stratified formations
are due. The igneous
rocks present ridges in the
mountains; sometimes they
are rounded at the summits,
while the aqueous and metamorphic
rocks are disposed in layers.</p>

</div>

<p>These two classes in their varieties form the land and the crust of the
earth, which is ever being acted upon by air and water. The ice, again,
polishes and scratches the valleys in which it moves. The loosened boulders
that tumble from the mountains are carried down by the ice, and deposited in
the glacier moraine, whence flows a stream. By degrees the stone is ground
up, and carried away in the water to form sediment in a “delta” at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
<em>embouchure</em>, or to lie beneath the surface and form rock once more. The
igneous rocks, composed of lavas and ashes, are volcanic rocks, deposited
deep down, and then after the lapse of ages disclosed by the action of air
and water.</p>

<p>The consideration of the land and water upon the globe shows us that
they are distributed over the earth very unequally. There is nearly three
times as much water in our planet as there is land, and these proportions
could not be altered without giving rise to phenomena, the results of which
cannot be properly estimated. Our earth has an area of 197,000,000 of
square miles; about 52,000,000 of this is land, and about 145,000,000 of
it water; so about three-quarters of the globe is made up of water. The
first portion of our subject therefore should be directed to the examination
and consideration of water, and the phenomena which arise from its presence
upon the earth.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_603.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 690.—Distribution of land and water.</div>
</div>

<p>We need not go into details which every geography indicates. We will
try to trace the <em>sources</em>, not the <em>plain effects</em>, which all can afterwards study
from special books. In a preceding portion of this volume we have explained
the chemical composition of water, and we showed by experiment that it is
a fluid composed of oxygen and hydrogen gases, in the proportions of one
to two volumes respectively. No matter in what form water may appear,—as
water, as ice, or as steam,—these proportions never vary in pure water
(<i>see</i><a href="#Page_352"> p. 352</a>). But water on the earth is seldom, or never, pure. We know
the difficulty we have to procure good drinking water, and though it may
be filtered, there will remain natural salts, which are found in different
degrees in all water upon the globe. We know the rain, which is perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
pure when condensed from the clouds, absorbs carbonic acid, etc., from the
atmosphere. We have shown how this water as soon as it comes upon the
earth attacks the rocks, and as it progresses carries away lime. After
descending deep down, it rises again in the form of <span class="smcap">Springs</span>.</p>

<p>Now what are these springs? They are the result of percolation of
rain-water through certain strata. When water falls it is absorbed into the
ground, unless it happens to rest upon an impermeable rock, in which case
it becomes a rivulet. But it can penetrate between the atoms of many rocks,
and thus falls through sand and harder rocks, till it reaches a stratum
which will not receive it—like clay. We then find that it will flow away in a
spring, or if tapped will be an Artesian well. These water-wells are of very
ancient date, but the name is more modern.<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> The springs flow out, and
develop, with the assistance of tributaries, into rivers. These again receive
more tributaries, which swell the volume of their waters, and widen out, carrying
millions of gallons hourly to the sea with sediment and gravel and stone.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_604.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 691.—Distribution of land and water.</div>
</div>

<p>Water has enormous power of disintegration. We have only to cast
our eyes upon the illustrations in any volume of continental travel in Europe
or America to perceive the gorges and cañons worn out by the resistless
and frequently gently-flowing river to estimate the part which water plays
in Physical Geography and Meteorology.</p>

<p>But springs occur not only in the case mentioned; there are mineral
springs, hot springs, and oil springs, all following the same rules of nature.
The Artesian well has been mentioned. The Geysers of Iceland have often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>
been portrayed, and are amongst the most wonderful phenomena of nature.
These will serve as a type of the other thermal springs, of which the districts
of the Yellowstone in North America afford perhaps the most extraordinary
instances. These are intermittent springs, and the water rises to a great
height, at intervals of about an hour and a half; and after many successive
attempts, or trials, as it were, the geyser shoots up to a great height
enveloped in steam.</p>

<p>The cause of these
well-known phenomena
have been explained by
Bunsen, and it has already
been referred to.
We know that at a certain
air-pressure water
boils at 212° (Fahr.),
but on mountains at
less pressure it will boil
before that degree, because
the air is rarefied.
So conversely, under
the ground, it may reach
212° without boiling.
So the surface (warm)
water falls, and reaches
a high temperature before
it is converted into
steam. When it is so
converted, the vapour is
formed
very
rapidly,
and
the expansive
force
is tremendous,
shooting up the water and all the contents of the tube with terrific violence,
and with a beautiful effect. Pressure therefore alters the boiling point of
water.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 692.—Geyser of the Yellowstone.</div>
</div>

<p>The mineral springs of Bath and many continental towns owe their
properties to the solvent power of water, which assimilates the mineral atoms
and gases. They arise just in the same way as the ordinary spring, the
taste and smell depending upon the soil and strata. Perhaps the oil wells
are the most curious phenomena of this kind. They are excavated upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
the Artesian principle. The petroleum is bored for, as we bore for water,
and the oil rushes up with great force,
and in enormous quantities. Gas wells
are also to be found in Pennsylvania,
and have supplied towns with gas for
years. Both these Artesian wells are
caused by the decay of vegetation.
The gas is in the coal formation, and the
oil has been pressed out from vegetable
deposit, and as anthracite is a stony coal,
petroleum is a kind of coal-tar, of natural
formation.</p>

<p>We have alluded to the river, which
emerges from the spring, which has fallen
as rain. But there is another, and, to
many minds, a much more interesting form
of the universal fluid we call water. This
is ice. Familiar as ice is, either to the
stay-at-home invalid, the skater, and the
traveller, there is a great deal to be said
about it. It is a subject we would dwell
upon had we space, for the remembrance
of many a pleasant hour passed upon
snow and glacier call upon us to go back
again, even though only in imagination.
No one who has not climbed the glacier—even
the Mer de Glace to the <i lang="fr">Jardin</i>,
now such a common excursion—can fail to
be struck with the beauty and grandeur of
the scene presented to him, and to carry
away a fond recollection of the icy regions
he penetrated.</p>

<p>For the ordinary hard-working man
there is no change, no rest so truly beneficial
as a trip amongst the mountains and
snowfields of Europe. He need not be a
climber; that is, a climber like Tyndall
or Whymper, those giants of the Alpine
Club. But a stroll up to the Bel Alp, the
Æggishhorn, the Riffel, the Montanvert, or
the Grimsel, will give the average pedestrian
some of the finest glacier scenery
in Europe, and which may, we believe,
compare with any in the world for beauty. These glaciers—ice-rivers—we
will now consider briefly. We may take the <i lang="fr">Mer de Glace</i> as an example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
(<i>see</i> the illustration, <a href="#Page_596">p. 596</a>). That gives us a very fair idea of the ice-river,
but the cut below is a good specimen of a glacier.</p>

<p>Suppose we start up from Chamouni, or come across from Argentières,
we shall reach the Montanvert by ascending through the wood, or by the
“Chapeau,” across the ice-sea. As we take the former course, we walk
alongside a white-flowing and rapid river, the Arve, which unites with
the Rhone below Geneva. This river divides, and if we keep alongside
one (the right or south branch), we shall reach the moraine and the
icy grotto, from which the water issues. It is in this way many large
rivers are born. The Rhine, the Rhone, the Aar, the Ticino, have all of
them their sources in the ice. The Visp and the Sass waters are other
almost equally well-known examples.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_607.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 694.—Source of the Rhine.</div>
</div>

<p>There used to be a grotto or
cavern, into which the tourist could
enter at the source of the Arveiron, and
here the beautiful blue of the ice could
be studied. From this place the Chapeau
is reached, up a stony path amid the trees, and from the top outside the hut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>
we can see the Mer de Glace all broken and contorted. The frequently
occurring roar of a falling rock which heat has deprived of its icy support,
or the cracking and tumbling of ice-blocks, may be seen and heard in the
forenoon. But the grandeur and majesty of the ice and snow-clad mountains
is best enjoyed by moonlight.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_608.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 695.—Glacier table.</div>
</div>

<p>On the ice we shall see huge stones and gravel and grit, which have
been carried down by the ever-moving glacier, which is denuded in its
course, and worn down upon the surface as it slides, scraping and grinding
the valley through which it flows. By passing along a path now made easy
by irons, but formerly without supports or guards, the surface of the glacier
will be reached, and a man with a hatchet will cut steps for the timid
traveller. We are now upon the deep ice-river, which has its springs in the
snowy regions of the Col de Géant, in the snow which is continually falling
upon the heights, and draining away to water again to form a river.</p>

<p>Thus the circle of events is completed,—snow, <i lang="fr">névé</i>, ice (glacier), water,
which last is again absorbed into the atmosphere, and again descends as
rain or snow. And this is
always going on by the action
of the sun. It may here
fairly be asked how snow becomes
ice. Why does not the
snow turn into ice at once,
and form a glacier at the
top of the mountain as well
as at the bottom? We will
endeavour to make this clear.
Snow is composed of crystals,
which assume certain definite
forms, and when first the flakes fall they are soft and powdery. By degrees
they melt a little, and when unconsolidated form what is termed <i lang="fr">névé</i>, the
border line between ice and snow. This semi-icy snow descends under pressure,
and, as it increases, the glacier is formed by huge blocks and masses being
pressed together on the steep slopes of the mountains. Thus the glacier descends,
rounding off rocks, and scouring as it goes, moving at a certain
estimated rate daily,—about twenty inches on the average,—carrying stones
and <em>débris</em> which form the moraine, and finally when the high temperature in
the valley melts the ice, it issues forth as a river into the plain, or bounds
down the mountain side in a cascade. An excursion—and one by no means
dangerous if a guide be taken—to the <i lang="fr">Jardin</i>, near Chamouni, will reveal
many interesting features of glacier formation, and of the glaciers themselves.</p>

<p>Physical Geography is therefore very much indebted to the action of
water as a fluid or as a solid. In the former condition it erodes the rocks,
carries down the stones and gravel and sand, forms deltas at the mouths of
rivers, and elevates plains by overflowing its banks and depositing sediment.
Water gives beautiful scenery, and the ever-changing features of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>
landscape are due to it. From the time the spring emerges to the time
when it has developed into a river, bearing fine ships upon its restless waters,
the universal fluid is always at its work of destruction and benefit combined.
From the limpid stream we pass to the salt ocean, the reservoir of all the
waters of the globe.</p>

<small>THE SEA AND THE SKY.</small></h2>

<p class="center">THE SEA—SALT WATER—WAVES AND THEIR EFFECTS—UNDER WATER—THE
FLOOR OF THE OCEAN.</p>


<p>From our childhood the sea has been the companion and playmate of
thousands, the seashore their playground. Men have selected it for their
professional training and livelihood. Authors write of it, poets apostrophize,
scientists lecture upon it, and fathom it, bringing up from its depths many
a new fact and illustration for those who cannot study it for themselves.
There is nothing like it, nothing more majestic, more beautiful, more life-giving
than the ocean—nothing so changeable nor so true.</p>

<p>From the days when we could toddle along the beach, picking up the
shells, we have wondered at the ocean—What was beyond it? What did it
conceal?</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What hidest thou in thy treasure-caves and cells,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thou hollow-sounding and mysterious main?”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Let us endeavour to find out.</p>

<p>The first thing that strikes us is the <em>saltness</em> of the sea. Sea water is
salt. Why? One reason is because salts are carried into it by rivers, and
besides, it is more beneficial as salt water. But let us look at the facts. We
know that the earth contains many “salts,” as we can see by the saline
springs. We have already given the chemical constitution of sea water, but
it will be useful to repeat the proportions.</p>

<p>Some portions of the sea are not so salt as others, or, in other words,
not so dense, and the saltness of the water prevents it being frozen so quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span>
as fresh water, which freezes at 32°. Salt water requires to be reduced to
28° before it freezes. Besides the various constituents mentioned above,
sea water has been found to contain boron, bromine, strontia, etc., and even
silver, for the copper of ships has been found to be impregnated with that
metal.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_611.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 697.—Going out.</div>
</div>

<p>If there is so much salt in the sea, it may be asked, why does it not
continually become greatly saltier by additions. The reason is because tons
of fresh water are continually pouring in, and though we can scarcely doubt
that the sea is becoming gradually more salt as years pass away, the increase
is very slight. On the other hand, evaporation is carrying water into the
air and leaving the salt behind it. In seas like the Red Sea, where there is
a great deal of evaporation and very little addition of fresh water in comparison,
the water is extremely salt and bitter. The Baltic has little salt
relatively to some parts of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Supposing that, as some allege, there are rocks of salt at the bottom of
the sea, we must remember that springs of fresh water frequently bubble up
to the surface of the ocean. This is a very curious phenomenon, and has
been attested by Humboldt. He states that near Cuba these springs arise
with considerable force, and the vessels trading on that coast get supplies of
fresh water from these ocean springs. There is, or was, a similar uprising in
the Gulf of Spezzia, and fresh water crustacea inhabit these localities. These
occurrences prevent the sea from becoming too salt by evaporation. When
salt water becomes tainted it is very offensive—much more so than fresh
water. If, therefore, the ocean were not continually in movement, it would
be very injurious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span></p>

<p>So much for the water of the sea; let us now see what it does. We will
glance at the surface ere we plunge into the depths.</p>

<p>In childhood, and even in after years, we most of us delight in watching
the waves of the sea. What finer sight than that we can obtain on the bold
Cornish coast with a westerly wind, when the great Atlantic waves come
rolling in and dashing up to the tops of the Tintagel cliffs, wearing and
grinding them away; hissing up the sands at New Quay, or thundering on
the shores of “Bude and Boss”! Then the wind abates, the sea goes down,
the billows become waves, the waves to wavelets grow, less and less, until
there is a mere ripple on the surface which is never still. The mighty
heaving of the ocean breast is the peculiarity of the sea.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_612.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 698.—Sea waves.</div>
</div>

<p>Yet, again, as we stand to watch the waves, or run from them as they
sweep in foam upon the sloping sand, we shall find that they increase or
decrease in force, and the level of the water rises or sinks by degrees. The
<em>tide</em> is flowing or ebbing as the case may be. So we know the surface has
another—a current motion—besides the undulation of the water. The
currents of the ocean are very valuable attributes, the Gulf Stream in
particular bringing us warmth and, indeed, rain. There are three movements
of the ocean—waves, currents, and tides.</p>

<p>The waves, perhaps, interest us most, as they come rolling in with
irregular force, but all mightily impelled by the wind. We have all noticed
the ripples on a puddle; the same action of the wind produces the grandeur
of the waves of the ocean. The wave comes rolling in before the wind to
break against the rocks or beach, and another forms to break in its place;
the higher the waves the more quickly they appear to move. But when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>
wind has subsided the rolling, or “swell,” remains,—a long, lazy, undulating
motion—a rocking to sleep of the billows of the sea. Without a ripple on
the surface these huge rollers will glide towards the shore and break upon
the shingle with a roaring sound which can be heard for miles, dragging the
pebbles after them as they recede with a rattling like bones and marbles.
The pebble ridge at Westward Ho! will illustrate this vividly at times, the
sound being heard far inland like continuous thunder, and on a calm night,
when there is no wind stirring, the roar of the ground swell is weird and
mysterious in the gloom.</p>

<p>The height of waves is very varied. Observers say that forty-four feet
is about the highest-known wave from hollow to crest. Waves of thirty-five
feet have been often met with, and off the Irish coast and in the Atlantic
sailors tell of waves “as big as houses.” But houses differ in size as do
waves.</p>

<p>The rate which waves are estimated to travel varies with the wind-propelling
force. The average hurricane wave travels at about forty-five
miles an hour. But earthquake waves—those set in motion by subaqueous
disturbance—have been known to travel at the rate of six hundred feet in a
second for thousands of miles across the ocean. Such a one occurred after
the earthquake which destroyed the town of Arica in August 1868, and the
wave crossed the Pacific to Chetham Islands, 5,520 miles, in fifteen hours
and twenty minutes. We have many of us seen the great tidal waves, or
“bores,” which at certain seasons rush up our rivers—the Severn, for instance—with
great violence, and at times forty feet high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span></p>

<p>These tidal waves are also experienced in the Ganges, the Amazon, and
at Bordeaux, as well as in China and elsewhere.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 700.—Tidal Attraction.</div>
</div>

<p>It may well be imagined that the tides also affect
the land, and the theory of these ocean movements is
a very interesting study. We have already referred to
it under <span class="smcap">Astronomy</span>, for the Sun’s and Moon’s attraction
is the main cause of the phenomenon, which is so
familiar and yet so strange. But the consideration of
the tides must be again entered upon here ere we proceed
to view the effects of the sea upon the land, and
how the physical geographical features alter.</p>

<p>Isaac Newton rightly attributed the cause of the
tides to the attraction of the moon and sun. Spring
tides occur when both luminaries are above the meridian,
and the neap, or low tides, happen when the sun and
moon are farthest apart. The highest tides are perceived
after a new or full moon; the lowest, after she has passed
the first or third quarter. In January the spring tide is
highest of all, because the earth is nearest to the sun
then, and his force of attraction, added to that of the moon, causes a very
high tide. With the assistance of the accompanying diagrams
we shall be able to make the tidal phenomena clear.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_614b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 701.—Tidal Attraction.</div>
</div>

<p>Suppose the moon to be at <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>, the point <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span> (the sea)
will be nearest to the moon and will be attracted, while
the earth will exercise a retarding power to a certain extent.
This attraction of the water from its usual level causes a
kind of vacuum, into which the surrounding water flows
and causes a high tide at <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>. At the opposite side the
earth, not the water, is most attracted, and then the water
rushes in to a certain extent to fill the vacancy left by the
earth’s movement towards the moon. Another high tide
is therefore caused at <span class="smcap lowercase">L</span>, but not so high as the tide upon
the opposite side, as the Moon is so much nearer the latter.
The tide, then, is only the natural movement of the sea
water to fill up the space the earth and other portions of
the watery mass have vacated in obedience to lunar and
solar attraction, which is, to a certain extent, counterbalanced
by the attraction and resistance of the earth.</p>

<p>The <em>neap</em> tides are caused by the opposing forces of
attraction of the sun and moon. The sun, as it were, pulls
one way, the moon the other. The latter (being nearer)
having twice the power of the former, causes a tide indeed,
but it is a low one. The <em>spring</em> tide occurs when sun and
moon together attract the water.</p>

<p>The effects of the rise of the tide are sometimes very disastrous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
and when the wind assists the sea, and heaps up the water, the sight is
grand in the extreme. On the coast of Schleswig, at Hallingen, the sea has
washed away a whole cluster of islands, and now the waves cause tremendous
inundations. About every six years, on the average, a great flood happens
for such trifles as a high tide are of no account. In 1362 and in 1834
terrible destruction was wrought; the coffins and bodies were washed out of
the graves. Piles of <em>débris</em> are then washed up, and sand and gravel accumulates
for a time till again carried away.</p>

<p>Travellers to France will notice the “dunes,” or sandhills of Calais, as
the train winds its way to Boulogne. We find that whenever the shore is
flat the shingle and sand are blown inwards and form “dunes,” and the sand
is distributed far inland, checking all vegetation, and altering the features of
the country. The wearing away of rocks by the water, the continual undermining
of them by the waves, and sometimes the disengagement of great
blocks weighing many tons—all these effects of the sea tend to alter the
appearance of the land. We may observe the denudation in many places
along the coast—the caves, holes, and tunnels eaten out by the water. In
Norway the “Fiords” are very remarkable. They were formed by the
upheaval of the land, and tell us of the glaciers which once filled them up.
Thus by ice and water the solid land is ground down and eaten away hourly,
daily, and for countless centuries, changing the place of the hard rock into
a standing water, and the flintstone into a springing well.</p>

ever reached living, and from which we have no information? We can lay
our telegraph or telephone lines beneath the waves, and far from the restless
waves in those quiet depths where no billows can reach. What treasures
must lie hidden at the bottom of the sea! The treasures, the gold and
silver, the merchandize, the wealth of centuries. The sailor lies sleeping

<p>What can we hope to find at the bottom of the sea we cannot reach?
Yes, but we can reach it. By sounding with Brooke’s lead (a cannon ball,
as shown in the illustration), we can arrive at a certain knowledge of the
composition of the ocean bed. The right-hand figure of the two is the lead
when being lowered, and while it is sinking
the cord remains tight. So soon as it
touches the bottom the weight of the
cannon ball divides the line, and the tube
is easily drawn up again. It has been
well greased, and so in the cavity of the
rod some shells and sand are found adhering.
These fragments tell us the composition
of the bottom of the sea.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_616.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 703.—Brooke’s Lead.</div>
</div>

<p>Here we find tiny shells, just as we
find them in chalk, the same formation as
that which piled up the cliffs which have
risen from, or been discovered, by the sea.
By other ingenious contrivances water can
be fetched up from the bottom of the
ocean, and the temperature can be gauged
all along the sounding line. The expedition of the <i>Challenger</i> brought many
interesting facts to light. Far down in these solitudes are marine animals,—crustacea,
star-fish, seaweeds, and shells,—all of which are carried up by
the dredge worked by a steam engine; for the resistance is very great, and
the weight supported at the depth of two miles must be considerable, and is
equal to four atmospheres. A thermometer has come up crushed even in
its iron case, and so the creatures which inhabit and find means to live at
the bottom of the sea must be specially fitted by Nature for the locality.</p>

<p>The configuration of the ocean bed has given rise to many different
opinions. It has been maintained that there are mountains and valleys,
hills and dales underneath the water, all clothed with marine vegetation,
equal in height and depth to the terrestrial hills and vales. Again it has
been declared that the ocean bed is level; but we find raised portions, which
we call islands, which may be the tops of mountains, or portions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span>
mainland separated from their parent continent by an inroad of the sea, as
are our islands of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The sea-bed, however, is very irregular. We find deep and steep
valleys, and high hills, but the picturesque peaks caused by the action of air,
frost, and water on earth are not, of course, represented under water.
Between the Irish coast and Newfoundland we are told the bed is level for
nearly four hundred miles. There is a deep declivity before we reach
this plain. The centre of the Atlantic is a plain, and on it the most volcanic
islands rise, such as Ascension and the Azores. Between England and
Greenland there was at one time a land communication, as we have remarked
under <span class="smcap">Geology</span>, and there are submarine terraces now. [An immense river
once ran through Western Europe somewhere about where our islands are.]</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_617.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 704—The Drag Net.</div>
</div>

<p>Under the Atlantic we have remains of <em>foraminifera</em> and other tiny
animals, with red clay and volcanic remains which must have been of
submarine origin. The Pacific shows us tops of mountains as islands
(Hawaii Isles), and an enormous range must be hidden beneath the waters.
What a change in the physical geography of the earth a slight sinking of
the water of the ocean would make; England and the Continent would be
united, and many sea-mountains (islands) discovered. The greatest ocean
depth is four miles and a half, but in many places a few hundred feet less
depth than at present would reveal many changes in the land.</p>

<p>Every year since the world has gained its present form the streams
and rivers have been pouring water, and carrying mud, stones, and gravel
ceaselessly into the ocean. In addition to this, the surface water washes
the stones away, animals (corals) build up islands from the depths, and take
up space in the ocean. We know that if we put our hand in a basin full of
water we displace a quantity of the fluid; so we might imagine that, the
sea being already full, every island formed would tend to an overflow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span>
of the sea, and the land would be thereby buried. That the sea does
encroach upon the earth we know, but it also recedes. Here is the balance
of Nature.</p>

<p>Rivers pour in water and material. The sun absorbs the water and
prevents overflow; tiny animals make shells from the material. All the
causes we have mentioned tend to permit the encroachment of the waters,
but volcanic action and even earthquakes act also to neutralize this tendency
by upheaving hills and mountains, which prevent the invasion of the sea by
its elevation or by land depression. We have seen in our chapters upon
<span class="smcap">Geology</span> how the ocean beds have been upheaved, and remains of marine
animals are daily found upon our highest hills. Thus the forces which
sometimes cause such destruction in the earth are the means whereby the
waters are kept in their places. But for volcanic action the land might all
disappear by denudation and continual wear and tear, and be deposited
at the bottom of the sea!</p>

<p>If it were not for currents, of which many defined ones exist in the
ocean, and the never-ceasing flow and ebb of the tides, the sea would soon
lose its purity and clearness. Though the water is salt and becoming salter,
animalculæ and all kinds of plant-animals would still increase and multiply;
so the decay of animal and vegetable matter would quickly render the
ocean a source of pestilence and death to mankind, and be most injurious to
animal life generally. But the movement is so ceaseless, and the various
fish and mammalia (whales, for instance), by preying upon each other, as
other animals on earth do, keep up the balance of production, and the organic
matter deposited in the sea is also cleared away.</p>

<p>That the constant currents of the sea prevent the formation and growth
of seaweed is clearly shown by the great “Sargasso Sea,” or tract of weed
(<i>Fucus natans</i>), called the Gulf-weed. This great tract embraces thousands
of square miles, and is situated in the very middle of the Atlantic Ocean,
where there are but few currents; but surrounding it is the Gulf-Stream, an
enormous current of water running at a regular rate of four or five miles an
hour. This Gulf-Stream is supposed to be caused by the same laws and
influences which determine the trade-winds—namely, a constant rarefaction
of the water at the tropical parts of the earth, and a corresponding condensation
at the Arctic portions, for warm water is much lighter than cold, and
when the waters of the tropical regions become lighter, the heavier waters
of the cold regions pressing down more forcibly tend to raise them above
their proper level; they therefore flow towards those very parts which have
sunk down by their contraction, and a constant current takes place; this
current is the Gulf-Stream. It runs from the Gulf of Mexico northwards
towards Newfoundland, turning by Iceland towards the British Isles, by
France and Spain, onwards to the coasts of Africa and South America, the
West Indies, and again to the Gulf of Mexico, although the return current
does not go by the name of Gulf-Stream. This great stream of water,
warmed by the tropical sun, serves the same two purposes fulfilled by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span>
trade-winds—namely, a circulation and distribution of the superfluous heat of
the equatorial regions, warming the northern countries; and cooling, by the
return of under-currents, those in the tropics. The fogs of Newfoundland
are caused by the great current of warm water entering the cold region and
carrying with them surface-currents of moist air, which the cold condenses
into fog, just as the breath is visible in a cold atmosphere. England owes
its moist and mild climate to the same cause. The depth of the Gulf-Stream
itself is very little. It is a mere layer of warm water. (<cite>See</cite> Sir George
Nares’ reports of the <i>Challenger</i> expedition.)</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 705.—Atoll, or Coral Island.</div>
</div>

<p>In the foregoing pages you have now seen, and, we hope, gained, some
information concerning the sea sufficient, at any rate, to induce you to enter
more deeply into the subject than we can at present do. We have learnt
how the sea water is composed, and what goes on on the surface. We have
discussed waves, and referred to tides and currents, the wearing away and
the renewal of land by the sea; we have dived beneath the surface, and found
something to interest us at the bottom of the ocean. As we come up again
we are surprised to find islands or reefs where none existed when we went
down. What has caused this sudden appearance? They may have been
slowly raised to the surface by coral insects, or suddenly by volcanic action.
Let us consider the coral, which plays a very important part in our Physical
Geography, before we proceed to the volcanic island.<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>The low-lying islands are those formed by the skeletons of the coral
insects, and the Coralline Islands are some of the most wonderful productions
of nature. They are only found in warm climates, between the twenty-eighth
degrees of north and south latitude, and limestone pure and simple is the
chief component of the coral reef, as it is of the mountains erupted from the
depths of the sea. “The detritus of corals, echinodermata shells, reticularia,
and other living creatures,” says a writer on this subject, “deposit not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span>
the salts of lime extracted from the ocean, but their own dead bodies to form
the hard substance of the rock.”</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 707.—Coral (<i>Madrepora brachiata</i>).</div>
</div>

<p>The coral insect is a zoophyte (Anthozoa), which, as
may be seen from the illustrations, assumes curious and elegant
forms, and the coral it produces is a limy or calcareous
deposit, which is fixed upon a rocky base. As years go
on these accretions become greater and greater, and at
length rise above the water. When a little distance below
it, the reefs form dangerous and frequently unsuspected
barriers, upon which ships are wrecked. The red coral is
dredged up from the Mediterranean, where there are extensive
coral fisheries. This coral is found deep in the water,
and never rises to the surface. Formerly there were coral
reefs in the European seas, but the changes of temperature
stopped their production. The “atolls,” or circular coral
reefs with an opening at one side, have been described by
Professor Darwin. “Who,”
says the great naturalist,
“would not be struck with
wonder and admiration on
catching sight for the first time of this vast
ring of coral rock, often many miles in diameter?
Sometimes a low green island is seen
beyond it, with a shore of dazzling whiteness;
outside is the foaming surf of the ocean, and within it a broad expanse of
tranquil water, of pale green colour and exquisite
purity.” These “atolls” mark the situation
of sunken islands, and the extension of
them and the barrier reefs would seem to indicate
a slow but decided sinking of the bottom
of the Indian and other oceans; but the “reefs”
tell us that the land to which they are attached
has not become depressed, and may have become
elevated. We may then conclude that
a continual rising and depression of the land
is taking place in various oceans, indicating a
sinking of the ocean bed in one locality and
the result of volcanic activity in another, for no
active volcanoes are found in the regions of depression.</p>

<p>We must now leave the sea and come to land again, to consider volcanoes
and volcanic action there.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Volcanoes and Earthquakes.</span></p>

<p>The various phenomena of volcanoes form a subject very difficult to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>
explained, as it is impossible to ascertain positively the cause of volcanic
action. Whether the earth is interiorly a mass of molten rock and fire, or
whether the heat is created by the intense contractile force and movement
of rocks, and their motion thus developed into heat aided by chemical
combination, we cannot absolutely determine. The theory restricting volcanic
phenomena to the upper crust of the earth, by supposing the local accumulations
of hot liquid masses of rock, which are forcibly emptied by the
expansion of vapours, may perhaps be found the true one.</p>

<p>The majority of the volcanoes are found near, or at no very great
distance from, the sea. We may therefore expect to find that water has
something to do with the eruptions as it has in the case of the Geysers.
But this hypothesis will scarcely hold good in every case, though volcanoes
of later ages are limited to regions very different from those in which volcanic
action used to be. For instance, in America we have only volcanoes on the
Pacific side, and the Andes furnish several. Mexico, Central America, and
California possess many volcanoes, and as far north as Alaska we find
Mount Elias. There are plenty of extinct volcanoes in Europe, but the
Mediterranean produces the active vents; and about the Red Sea and the
Caspian, and even in the central chain of Asia, there are volcanoes far from
water. The Hawaii isles, on the other hand, are all volcanic, and Australasia
furnishes us with remarkable specimens; so altogether the testimony tends
to prove that where volcanic remains are apparent the sea had at one time
been, or now is, near at hand.</p>

<p>Burning mountains have been familiar to us from our childhood in
pictures, and by stirring narrative of destruction wrought by them. The
volcano is generally a mountain rising to a cone, but Vesuvius presented
quite the appearance of a hollow basin at the top, before it suddenly broke
forth and buried Herculaneum in ashes. Von Buck visited it in 1799,
and declares it had at one time risen, like an island, from the sea. There
are about two hundred and seventy volcanoes at present in activity; four in
Europe; eleven in Iceland and Jan Meyen’s land; in Asia, ninety-three;
in Africa, twenty-six; forty-six in North America and the Aleutian Isles;
twenty-seven in Central America and the Antilles; in South America,
thirty-one; and twenty-four islands with volcanic tendencies largely developed.
There may be many more “resting.”</p>

<p>Volcanoes, then, are openings or vents which communicate with the
melted rock within the earth, and the conical form of volcanoes is owing to
the deposits of volcanic matter as it falls from the opening called the <em>crater</em>.
If we let a small spade full of mould run through our hands, or from the
spade, it will form a small cone, the heavier particles sliding to the base at
a certain slope. Thus the volcano builds its own hill, and inside the crater
we find cones from which smoke and steam issue. These cones within the
cone are the points of issue of vapour and smoke, miniature volcanoes making
up a whole.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 709.—Eruption of Vesuvius, August 26th, 1872.</div>

<p>The signs of eruptions are much the same, and usually occur a couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span>
of days before the actual outbreak takes place. First smoke is perceived,
perhaps, and the escape of various noxious gases accompanied by earthquakes
occur. Now the eruption may commence and blow away the summit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>
the mountain, as in the case of the commencement of the catastrophe of
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 79, when the whole side of Vesuvius was torn away, and continuous
showers of ashes fell for days and nights, burying everything, while the hot
lava poured down the sides. Stones and ashes with vapours are hurled into
the air. Clouds of steam are formed, and vivid electrical discharges take
place in these clouds, while water dashes down, carrying stones (“volcanic
bombs”), and reflected lurid flames from within are cast on the steaming
clouds, which look like fiery columns. Then the lava issues in a white, hot,
steady, irresistible stream, covering everything, and burning up all vegetation.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 710.—Birth of a volcano.</div>
</div>

<p>New volcanoes are continually in process of formation, and at
Santorin for hundreds of years volcanic action has been busy in forming
islands. These violent efforts of Nature frequently give rise to
earthquakes, which are the most destructive of natural convulsions.
The records of late occurrences are fresh in the minds of all readers,
and need not be specified. The slow subsidence and gradual upheaval
of the land is still going on, but we are frequently startled by the
account of a rupture of the ground or the destruction of a portion of a
city.</p>

<p>The motion of the earthquake is generally in a direct line, and undulating.
Sometimes what are termed vertical shocks arise and destroy solidly-built
edifices. Mountains have been overturned by earthquake shocks, and
trees have been twisted round. Sometimes the ground yawns into enormous
fissures. The sea is tossed into great waves and encroaches upon the land,
and when the sea recedes the recession of the water is followed by a more
terrible invading wave sweeping all before it. Earth tremblings often occur
far away from volcanoes, and without any visible connection with volcanic
action. There are many aspects of land and water which the student of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span>
geography will remember, but which need not be separately treated of. We
must, however, refer to plains, plateaus, and lakes. The mountains also play
a most important part in Physical Geography and in “Climatology,” as they
collect the vapours for rain, and make the valleys fertile, and thick with
vegetation. We have spoken of the mountains under <span class="smcap">Geology</span>, and the
various formations and strata will be found enumerated there, but now we
have to do with the mountain chains in their physical aspect as regards their
shape and appearance on the globe.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_624.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 711.—Earthquake fissures.</div>
</div>

<p>Any elevation rising from a base more than 1,000 feet may fairly be
termed a mountain, and solitary mountains are usually volcanic, because
eruptive rock does not produce chains of mountains. The origin of
mountains is probably due to the contraction and compression of the crust of
the earth—not merely the surface, but the whole thickness between us and the
supposed molten interior. Mountains did not exist from everlasting, for the
very good reason that they are (in most cases) composed of stratified rocks.
Stratified rocks are sedimentary rocks, and must have been deposited below
water, and hardened long before they were thrust up by pressure. Moreover,
we find (as has already been explained) shells and remains of marine animals
on the higher summits, which prove to demonstration that these mountains
are composed of rocks which were laid down under the sea.</p>

<p>Professor Dana was one of the first geologists to advance the theory
that contraction and lateral displacement are the causes of the elevation of
mountains. A very good illustration of this theory was made by Chamontier,
who covered an india-rubber balloon with a thick layer of wax, and when it
had hardened sufficiently he pricked a hole in the bladder, which immediately
contracted, and the wax at once rose up into tiny similitudes of mountains,
showing in a sufficiently clear manner that such protuberances may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span>
produced by the pressure of the earth’s contraction, and in such a mass as
our earth the elevations would naturally be very great.</p>

<p>Professor Geikie has shown how, by a very simple experiment, the
contortion of mountain strata is effected by pressure. A number of cloths
or towels placed flat on a table represent the sedimentary rocks. Place
a board with a weight on the top, and the towels will remain flattened.
But by holding two boards at the sides and pressing them together (the
weighted board still remaining), we shall find the towels crumpled and
upheaved like the Jurassic strata shown in the illustration (fig. 712).
Professor Heim calls the central masses wrinkles of the earth’s crust. So
the Alps were pressed up or heaved into the air, the weather—rain, frost,
snow, and sunshine—imparting the infinite variety of “Horn,” “Needle,” and
“Peak,” so expressively applied in Alpine nomenclature;—the Matterhorn,
Wetterhorn, Weisshorn; the Pic du Midi, Aiguille de Dru, Aiguille Verte, and
many other mountains in well-trodden
Switzerland will occur to the reader at
once.</p>

<p>The slopes of mountains—though
to the casual observer they may appear
very much the same—are very different.
We sometimes find a long, easy ascent,
—more usually a steepish inclination,
perhaps 20°;—in other places, such as
on the Matterhorn, an almost perpendicular
face. Forty-five degrees rise is very
steep, and 53° is the limit of any great
mountain’s slope. Cliffs and precipices
there are, of course; witness the terrible
fall from the Matterhorn to the glacier below—thousands of feet with one
tremendous leap from the rock to the ice underneath; but mountain <em>slopes</em> are
not precipices. As a rule, we find that one side of a mountain chain is steeper
than the opposite one. It is harder to climb up from Italy to Switzerland
than to ascend in the opposite direction. The Pyrenees are also steeper on
the south side. The Scandinavian mountains likewise are steeper in the
west. The Himalaya are steepest towards the sea, so are the Ghauts.
We here find a difference between the slopes of the <span class="smcap">New</span> and <span class="smcap">Old Worlds</span>.
In the former we have the less precipitous mountain slopes towards the east;
in the old world they are towards the north, and an inspection of a physical
map of the world leads us to the conclusion that the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans are the boundaries of entirely different degrees of slopes. The Pacific
and Indian Oceans would appear to border the more precipitous mountain
sides; the Atlantic and its connections those less steep.</p>

<p>As a rule, we have the most elevated portions of the earth, mountains,
and high tablelands, in equatorial regions; and within the torrid zone every
terrestrial climate is to be found, owing to the snows of the high mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
and the heat of the valleys, which are naturally closely connected with the
upheaval of mountain ranges. We have already spoken of the never-ceasing
influences of the air and water upon the rocks, and we need say little about
valleys. There are valleys of dislocation, denudation, and undulation. The
great valley of Western Asia, wherein lie the Caspian and Aral seas, seems
to have been caused by the upheaval of the Caucasus and the Persian plateau.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plains</span> are very varied. We have European <em>Heaths</em> and <em>Landes</em>;
American <em>Savannahs</em>, <em>Prairies</em>, and <em>Pampas</em>; Asian <em>Steppes</em>, and African
<em>Deserts</em>. All of these possess certain features in common, more or less
vegetation, and sometimes absolute sterility.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plateaus</span>, or <em>Tablelands</em>, are
elevated plains frequently undulating
in character. The Plateau of Bolivia
is 13,000 feet high, and extends
along by the Andes. The tableland
of Quito is nearly 10,000 feet high,
and borders on the giants Cotopaxi
and Chimbarazo.</p>

<p>Rivers and lakes add not only
to the wealth of nations by their
usefulness, but, by the additional picturesqueness
of their appearance, to
the beauty of the landscape. The
velocity of rivers would be very much
increased if it were not for the strong
resistance offered by the banks and
the stones to the current, and by friction.
The Rhine and the Rhone, if
thus unimpeded, would flow at a rate
considerably over one hundred miles
an hour; and our own little stream
(the Thames), instead of eddying
peacefully and twirling gracefully by
Medmenham or Cookham, would rush along at the speed of the train which
so often crosses it on its way to the sea.</p>

<p>The slopes of river-beds, like the slopes of mountains, vary very considerably,
and the inclination of a river varies at different places; in a distance
of seven hundred miles the Amazon only falls twelve feet, and the
current flows chiefly by impetus already acquired. A slope of one foot in
two hundred precludes all navigation, and at still greater inclines rapids and
cataracts are formed—the great falls wearing away the river-bed by degrees;
so it is calculated that hundreds of years ago Niagara Fall was much
farther down the river, and the cataract is slowly moving up stream. In
time, as the rock wears away, the height will disappear as the celebrated
“Falls,” and will become a rapid within a few miles of the lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</a></span></p>

<p>Lakes are derived from river-drainage and springs. Some are very
salt, owing to evaporation carrying away so much water, and leaving the
accumulated mineral salts. These very salt lakes are likely to dry up, as
the supply of water is not equal to the demands of evaporation. Floating
islands appear and disappear on many lakes. Derwentwater is one instance.
On the uses of lakes and rivers it would be superfluous to dwell. We are
more concerned to examine their influence on climate, and in this sense
we must also consider mountains. But we will now group all the phenomena
of the air and water, and their effect upon climate, under “Meteorology”
in the chapters next following.</p>

<p>Under this heading we shall find the atmosphere playing a very important
part. The air is composed of oxygen and nitrogen with some
carbonic acid gas and aqueous vapour. We have, under the Chemistry
section, discussed these constituents which unite to make up the air or
atmosphere in the following proportions:—</p>

<p>It is a fact that all over the world the same chemical result is found.
Whether we bottle up the air in the valley, or, as Gay-Lussac did, go up
to an elevation of 21,000 feet in a balloon, we shall find the air of the
same chemical composition. In Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, it is
all the same. The pressure is less as we ascend, and we cannot manage to
breathe in very high altitudes so well as upon the ground <em>for which we were
fitted</em>, but the air is the same.</p>

<p>The atmosphere, then, is not always equal in density, nor is it quite
transparent. The light from sun and stars is, to a certain extent, lost, and
it has been calculated that the sun’s rays lose one-fifth part of their brightness
passing through the atmosphere. We all know what the air is. We
breathe it, we feel it blowing, we witness its effects. Were it not composed
as it is we should die or go mad; plants would not live, and the earth
would become a desert. Air is everywhere—invisible; a so-called empty
vessel is full of air because an animal will live in it till the atmosphere
has become vitiated by the carbonic acid from the lungs. Yet air, or rather
its watery portion, is visible when condensed.</p>

<p>Vapour is not perceptible. But how does it become so? We cannot
see the air, how can we see a portion of it? We can answer this question
by illustration. The steam from an engine is not visible on a very hot
day. But when the day is damp and dull the vapour is <em>condensed</em>, and
becomes visible; then air appears and is resolved into vapour again. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span>
change was effected by heating water and then cooling it, when it came
back to water again. This watery vapour is always present in the atmosphere.
Heat, also, is present in the atmosphere, and the sun is the origin
of that heat.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">Fig. 714.—High tide and storm on the coast of Schleswig.</div>
</div>

<p>Heat, we know, is the effects of the rapid motion of small particles of
matter, and is radiated from our bodies—so we feel cold; it reaches our
bodies, and we feel warm. So air is heated or cooled by the sun, not in its
absence, except when the earth and air have been so warmed during the day
that the heat is given out by them long after sunset. We have read of the
pressure of the atmosphere in the <span class="smcap">Physics</span> section, and that warm air is
lighter than cold air, as shown in the ascension of the Montgolfier balloon.
It is this variation of temperature of the atmosphere that gives birth to one
great meteorological agent—viz., the <span class="smcap">Wind</span>, which we will now consider.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Winds and Air Currents.</span></p>

<p>We can easily illustrate the cause of winds. Suppose we have a hot
room and a cold one, and we suddenly open the door of communication
between them, the heated air which has risen to the ceiling of one room
will rush out through the upper part of the opening of the door, and the
cooler current will flow in just above the floor. If we place a lighted candle
in the upper and lower part of the opening we shall see the flame tending
outwards from the heated room, and in an opposite direction from the cold
room. In the centre of the open door there will be but slight disturbance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>
So it is in nature. The warm air ascends, cooler air rushes in to fill the
space, and a storm or a breeze is created. The balance must be restored.
The upper current probably moves one way, and the lower the other way.
Thus clouds are said to be “coming up against the wind” when they are
moving in an upper current, or in a different direction to that the wind is
blowing just above the earth’s surface.</p>

<p>The wind moves, with varying velocity. We have a gentle breeze
when the motion of the air is about five or six miles an hour, a good
breeze at twenty-five miles an hour, a high wind at thirty-five, and a gale at
fifty. Hurricanes travel at sixty and seventy miles an hour, and do enormous
damage. Near the Equator we do not find much wind, and this fact
has caused the name of the Region of Calms, or “The Doldrums” of sailors,
to be bestowed upon that portion of the globe, but this belt of calm has
no fixed position. It follows the sun’s course, and is the region of greatest
heat, and, as it were, the centre of a concentric circle of currents. The hot
air rises and goes away; air rushes in north and south, and causes what are
called the North-East and South-East Trades, or Trade Winds, owing to
their being so useful in commerce for ships, or to the old meaning of the
word trade, a “regular course.” The calms of the Tropic of Cancer are
called the “Horse Latitudes.”</p>

<p>Readers of the life of Columbus will remember how his crew were
affrighted at the persistency of the wind which bore him across, for no sail
requires shifting, nor is a sheet altered while the vessel is making way with
the “Trades.” Were the earth covered with water, we should find the trade-winds
blowing equally over the surface, but the varying temperature of the
land diverts them. The rarefaction of the air in the Sahara causes a westerly
wind to prevail, which blows towards the land, instead of the trade wind we
might expect to find.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Monsoons</span>, again, are caused in like manner, for the ordinary
“trade” from the south-east is changed by the elevation of the heated air in
Central Asia into a south-west wind, and so in the south, in consequence of
the heated air from Australia, the north-west trade appears as a north-east
monsoon, but is altered to a north-west wind. Nearly all the year round,
therefore, we find the two winds, which are modifications of the “trades,”
blowing in different directions and from different quarters. From November
to March there is a north-east wind north of the Equator, and a north-west
wind blows south of the Equator. From April to September a south-west
wind blows at the north, and a south-east wind at the south of the line.
The term monsoon signifies a “season,” and the changes of these winds give
rise to tremendous storms causing great havoc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sea</span> and <span class="smcap">Land</span> breezes are really little monsoons; they are caused by
the heat of the sun in just the same way, but with miniature results. We
all know the sea-breeze which comes in as the land gets hot during the day,
for the land warms more quickly than the sea under equally existing circumstances.
So again, in the evening, the land loses its heat more quickly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span>
then the cool air flows out again to take the place of the warmer sea air
which is continuing to ascend. The intensity and regularity varies when
the degrees of heat are most different between land and sea and in tropical
regions; and the varied coast formation will of course affect the wind, but
as a rule the fact may be accepted as plainly explained, sea-breeze in the
morning, land-breeze at night, and amateur sailors in boats at our watering-places
will do well to bear this in mind.</p>

<p>There are a great number of local winds deriving their names from
their direction or influence. We may mention them briefly. The special
terms for winds are—</p>

<ul class="table"><li>The North Wind, or Tramontana.</li>
<li>The North-East Wind, or Greco.</li>
<li>The East Wind, or Levanter.</li>
<li>The South-East Wind, or Sirocco.</li>
<li>The South Wind, or Ostro.</li>
<li>The South-West Wind, or Libeccio.</li>
<li>The West Wind, or Ponente.</li>
<li>The North-West Wind, or Maestro-Mistral.</li></ul>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_631.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 715.—On a lee shore.</div>
</div>

<p>The Mistral, or Maestrale, is well known at Nice as the north wind,
while at Toulon it is a north-east wind. The other winds, such as the
Sirocco, which in some places is a warm, damp wind, in Madeira is a hot
wind, and likewise in Sicily, where it is equally warm and damp like steam.
It has different names in various countries, such as Samiel in Turkey, and
sometimes as Föhn in Switzerland, where it may, however, be a north wind—which,
as all travellers know, is a dry and a hazy-weather breeze, yet sometimes
moist. The <em>Simoon</em> is a very hot wind raising sand-storms in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span>
deserts, and experience has shown it to be very prejudicial to life in consequence
of the fine sand and the tremendous heat it carries with it. Egypt
is subject to another hot wind, called the <em>Khamsin</em>, and the west coast of
Africa is subject to the <em>Harmattan</em>, a dry, easterly wind. The cold, dry
wind of the Himalaya is known as the Tereno. In South America there is
the same wind, the <em>Pampero</em> blowing east and south-east. The Euroclydon,
mentioned by St. Paul, is the modern <em>bora</em> over the Adriatic. Malta rejoices
(or laments) in the Gregale, a north-east wind. There are several other
terms, such as the Puna of Peru, a very drying wind; the Purgas in
Labrador, the Tourmente in France, and Guxen in Switzerland. Then we
have the <em>Hurricane</em>, from “Ouracan” of the Caribs; the <em>Typhone</em>, or Tae-fun
of China, so called from the dreaded god Typhon of Egypt; and the
<em>Tornado</em>—all very violent winds, and circling round, causing, so to speak,
whirlwinds, by which trees are uprooted, and houses destroyed.</p>

<p>The measure of the velocity of wind is performed by anemometers,
which record the velocity in feet per second, and the amount of pressure.
The anemometer is a well-known apparatus, with its four arms terminating
in “cups” and a “tablet” anemometer, which is more or less disturbed or
deflected from the vertical line by each gust of wind, and thus the score of
degrees is marked by an indicator, which is moved as the tablet is deflected.
We annex a table of wind pressure and velocity—</p>

<p>The south-west wind is more constant than any other, and the west
wind in our islands is more frequent than the east; tables have been compiled
showing the average number of days upon which the winds blow from
different quarters, but need not be quoted. Storms can generally be antici<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span>pated
by the barometer, which falls very quickly for “wind.” The quarter
whence the breeze may be expected is often indicated by the streamers of
clouds, or “mare’s tails,” across the sky; though we must admit the <em>opposite</em>
direction to that anticipated by casual observers may often prove the right
one.</p>

<p>Hurricanes and tornadoes are really whirlwinds in motion. The rotatory
movement of the air is from right to left in the northern hemisphere, and
from left to right in the southern—that is, in the opposite and same directions
respectively as the hands of a watch move. The whirlwinds are caused by
two currents of air meeting at a certain angle, just as a whirlpool is the
result of opposing currents of water.</p>

<p>The use of the wind in nature cannot be over-estimated. It is frequently
destructive and terrible in its effects, but these comparatively trifling damages
are as nothing when weighed against the advantages conferred upon mankind
by the wind and the currents of the atmosphere. The north cold is tempered
by the warm south wind. The pollen and the seeds of plants are borne
on the wings of the wind, and the clouds are carried over the land to “drop
fatness” upon our fields. The want of free circulation of air is very injurious.
Witness the terrible affliction of <em>goitre</em>, so prevalent in the closely shut-in
valleys such as the Rhone Valley, where cretinism or congenital idiotcy is
distressingly prevalent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Vapour and Clouds.</span></p>

<p>Vapour, as we have heard, is invisible, and is produced by heat. As
the visible steam (which is invisible as it issues from the safety valve at the
actual aperture, and nearly invisible altogether on a hot day) is produced by
combustion, so vapour is produced by the heat of the sun’s rays. But there
are some observations to be made respecting these rays, which are the cause
of vapour, and therefore of cloud, rain, dew, frost, ice, snow, and water all
over the earth; and we must look at the circumstances closely.</p>

<p>Those who have followed us through this volume will remember that
at the end of Chapter VIII. we remarked upon the spectrum, and made a
few observations respecting the <em>heat</em> spectrum, and the velocity of light rays,
which became too rapid to be observed, and then they developed heat—<em>invisible
heat</em>—produced by non-luminous waves, which proceed from the sun as
surely as visible rays or light. Professor Tyndall has written very pleasantly
upon this subject, and, with his clear leading, any reader can study for
himself.</p>

<p>We have now arrived at the conclusion that there are visible and
invisible rays giving us respectively light and heat. These latter are the
means whereby the ice is melted, and by which water is evaporated to
vapour, and formed into <span class="smcap">Clouds</span> when it is chilled or condensed. Here is
another link in the beautiful chain constructed by Nature. We cannot
penetrate far into any portion of the system of the universe without being
struck with the wondrous harmony that exists between every portion of it.
Thus heat and light, vapour, cloud, rain, dew, and ice are all intimately
connected.</p>

<p>A cloud, then, is a visible body of vapour in the atmosphere, which is
supported by an invisible body of vapour. It will remain thus invisible so
long as the atmosphere is not saturated with moisture. The air can contain a
great quantity of moisture without its being rendered visible, and so when
the day is hot we see no steam from the locomotive. It is absorbed into
the dry atmosphere. But when the day is “damp” we find that the air
has nearly as much moisture as it can carry, and the steam is condensed, a
portion falling in tiny drops like rain. This is proved every day in cold
weather when ice is found in the windows—the cold air has condensed and
frozen the water breathed out from our lungs, and <em>snow</em> has been known to
fall in a ball-room when a cold current of air was admitted.</p>

<p>People are sometimes apt to think that if the sun were very hot,
glaciers, and such icy masses, would diminish; but we think after what has
been said respecting the power of the sun’s rays to evaporate water, all will
see that the contrary is the fact. Without sun-heat we should have no
cloud, and as clouds give us rain and snow and ice and glacier, we must
come quickly to the conclusion that glaciers and snow are the direct <em>results</em> of
the heat of the sun. The “light” rays of the sun do not penetrate snow, and
that is why our eyes are so affected in snowy regions. The poor <em>Jeannette</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span>
sufferers a short time since were blinded by reflected light, and dark
spectacles are worn on all Alpine expeditions. The <em>invisible</em> rays, as we
have said, dissolve the ice into rivers.</p>

<p>The atmosphere produces clouds by expansion of vapour, which chills
or cools it, and it descends as rain. To prove that expansion cools air is
easy by experiment, but if we have no apparatus we must make use of our
mouths. In the body the breath is warm, as we can assure ourselves by
opening our mouths wide and breathing upon our hands. But close the
mouth and blow the same breath outwards through a very small aperture.
It is in a slight degree compressed as it issues from the lips, and expanding
again in the atmosphere feels colder. Air compressed into a machine and
permitted to escape will form ice.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 717.—Cumulus cloud.</div>

<p>Water is present in clouds which assume very fantastic and beautiful
forms. We know nothing more enjoyable than to sit watching the masses of
cumuli on a fine afternoon. The grand masses built up like the Alps appear
to be actual mountains, and yet we know they are but vapour floating in the
air, and presently to meet with clouds of an opposite disposition, and produce
a thunderstorm with torrents of rain. Those who will devote a few minutes
every day to the steady examination of clouds, will not be disappointed.
They give us all the grandeur of terrestrial scenery. Mountains, plains, white
“fleecy seas,” upon which tiny cloudlets float, and low upon the imaginary yet
apparent horizon, rise other clouds and mimic mountains far and farther
away in never-ending distance.</p>

<p>A pretty, light, feathery cloud, with curling tips and fibres, is known
as <em>cirrus</em>, and exists at a very great elevation. Gay-Lussac went up in a
balloon 23,000 feet, and even at that height the cirri was far above him in
space. We can readily understand that at such an extreme elevation they
must be very cold, and they are supposed to consist of tiny particles of ice.
Such clouds as these are very frequently observed at night, as cirro-cumulus
around the moon, and a yellowish halo, apparent to all observers, is thought
to be coloured by the icy particles of the lofty <em>cirrus</em>. The beautiful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span>
varied phenomena of perihelia, etc., are due also to the snowy or icy flakes
of the cirri and cirri-cumuli, caused by the refraction of light from the frozen
particles. These cirri clouds are indicative of changeable weather as “Mares’
tail” skies, and long wisps of cloud, foretelling storm.</p>

<p>The <em>cirro-cumulus</em> is the true “mackerel” sky, and is formed by the
cirri falling a little and breaking off into small pieces of <em>cumulus</em>, which is a
summer (day) cloud generally, and appears in the beautifully massive and
rounded forms so familiar. The <em>stratus</em> is, as its name implies, a cloudy layer
formed like strata of rock. It is generally observable at night and in the
winter. It often appears suddenly in the sky consequent upon diminished
pressure or a rapid fall of temperature. It is low-lying cloud sometimes,
and at night forms fogs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_636.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 718.—Cirrus cloud.</div>
</div>

<p>The <em>cirro-stratus</em> is perceived in long parallel lines, and indicates rain;
when made-up rows of little curved clouds it is a certain prophet of storm,
and when viewed as haze is also indicative of rain or snow. “Mock-suns”
and halos are often observed in the cirro-stratus.</p>

<p>The <em>nimbus</em> is the rain-cloud, or condition of a cloud in which rain falls
from it. It is upon this rain-cloud we can perceive the rainbow, and on no
other cloud, but otherwise only in the sky.</p>

<p>We have now seen the varieties of cloud and their common origin with
fogs and mists, which differ from them only in the elevation at which they
come into existence, according to the condition of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The uses of clouds are many and varied. Their first and most apparent
use seems to be the collection and distribution of rain upon the earth. But
besides this, they shelter us from the too great heat of the sun, and check
the evaporation at night. Supposing we had no clouds we should have no
rain. If we had no rain the earth would dry up, and the globe would appear
as the side of the moon appears—a waterless desert. The invisible vapour
in the atmosphere will produce cloud, but the moon can have no atmosphere
in that sense. Vapour will also absorb heat, and intercept the sun’s heat
rays, acting much as clouds do in preventing radiation and great changes of
temperature.<a id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span></p>

<p>All animals and plants depend upon moisture in the atmosphere as
much as upon the varying degrees of warmth. A dry east wind effects us
all prejudicially; warm, soft airs influence us again in other ways. Air will
be found drier as a rule in continents than in islands or maritime districts,
and this will account for the clearness of the sky in continental regions.
Fogs and mists arise when the air is what is termed saturated with moisture,
and colder than the earth or waters upon it. So the celebrated and dangerous
fogbanks of Newfoundland arise from the warm water of the Gulf Stream,
which is higher in temperature than the air already saturated. And the
same effect is produced when a warm wind blows against a cold mountain;
the air is cooled, and condenses in cloud.</p>

<p>The cooling of the breath by the exterior air is exemplified in winter
when we can perceive the vapour issuing from our mouths as we speak.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_637.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 719.—Storm clouds.</div>
</div>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rain, Snow, and Dew.</span></p>

<p>Rain is produced by the condensation of vapour. “Vesicular vapours,
or minute globules of water filled with air,” compose the clouds, and at
last these vesicles form drops, and get heavy enough to come to the ground.
Perhaps they are not sufficiently heavy to do so, and then they are absorbed
or resolved into vapour again before they can get so far, because the lower
strata of air are not yet saturated, and can therefore contain more moisture.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we may experience rain from a cloudless sky. This
is no very uncommon case, and occurs in consequence of the disturbance of
the upper strata when warm and cold currents come into collision and
condense the vapours.</p>

<p>Rain is very unequally distributed. We shall find that the region of
calms, which we mentioned in a former page, is also the zone of the greatest
amount of rain. The heated air rises and falls back again, there being little
or no wind to carry it away. The rainy season, therefore, sets in when a
place enters the zone of calms. Equatorial districts have two rainy seasons,
as they enter twice a year into the region of calms, but most places have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span>
only a wet and dry season, while north and south of the calm region we find
rainless districts, or zones tempered by the trade winds, which are dry winds.</p>

<p>But if we suppose—as indeed is the case in South America—that these
dry winds happen to come in contact with a cool mountain, the moisture of
the air is precipitated in rain. In Australia, on the contrary, we have
portions of land actually burnt up for want of rain, because the mountain chain
breaks the clouds, so to speak, on a limited corner of the island, while the
interior is parched. The winds also coming over India from the Bay of
Bengal discharge clouds and rain in the Himalayan slopes. So we perceive
that the situation of mountain chains have much to do with the rain-fall,
and of necessity, therefore, with the vegetation and fertility of the land.
This is another noticeable link in the great chain of Nature.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_638.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 720.—Meteorological Observatory, Pic du Midi.</div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps it may now be understood why westerly and south-westerly
winds bring rain upon our islands, and why the counties such as Westmoreland
and Cumberland and those in Wales receive more rain than any other
part of the United Kingdom. Seathwaite, so well known to tourists in the
lake district, has the proud position of the wettest place in these islands.
We find that when the westerly wind sets in it has come across the warm
Atlantic water and become laden with moisture, which, when chilled by the
mountains, is precipitated as rain.</p>

<p>The amount of rain that falls in the United Kingdom is carefully
measured by rain-gauges, some of which are extremely simple. The water
is caught in a funnel-mouthed tube, and measured in a measuring glass every
four-and-twenty hours. Thereby we can tell the annual rainfall in any given
district, whether it be twenty inches or a hundred. One inch of rain actually
means one hundred tons of water falling upon one acre of land. Therefore,
if the annual report of rainfall (including all moisture) be twenty inches, we
have an aggregate of 2,000 tons of water upon every acre of surface within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span>
the district. Twenty inches is a very low estimate. Some places have an
annual rainfall of forty or fifty inches. In Cumberland we find 165 inches
has been recorded! If we then multiply these last figures we get the enormous
quantity of 16,500 tons of water upon every acre of land in the district in
one year. It is reported from India that in the Khasia Hills the average is
610 inches, which must be the maximum rainfall in the world. At other
places, in the north-west provinces, the fall is only seven inches. Sometimes
in tropical rains we find fifteen inches of rain in a day, and that has been
exceeded.</p>

<p>We can now judge of the enormous amount of moisture carried up by
the sun and dispersed over the earth in rain, which swells our brooks and
rivers, cleanses the air of its impurities, supplies our springs, carries with it
into the sea lime from the rocks for the shells of marine animals, and then
leaving its salts, is again evaporated to form clouds, which discharge the fresh
water continually upon the earth in a never-ceasing rotation.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Snow.</span></p>

<p>“We all know what <span class="smcap">Snow</span> is,” you will say, perhaps. Well, then,
will any ordinary young reader tell me what he knows about snow?
“It falls from the sky in white flakes,” says one. “It’s frozen rain,” remarks
another. “Why, snow <em>is</em> snow,” says a third. “There’s nothing like it; it’s
white rain-water frozen.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_639.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 721.—Crystals of snow.</div>
</div>

<p>The last answer we received is the nearest of all. Snow is not snow,
paradoxical as that sounds. <em>Snow is Ice!</em> Flakes of snow are ice-crystals—white,
because reflecting light. In the section of <span class="smcap">Mineralogy</span> we mentioned
crystals, which are certain definite shapes assumed by all substances, and we
gave many examples of them. Just as alum crystallizes and rock crystal
assumes varied and beautiful forms, so ice crystallizes into six-rayed stars.</p>

<p>It is to Professor Tyndall that the world is chiefly indebted for the
descriptions of snow crystals and ice flowers. In his work upon “Heat as a
Mode of Motion,” this charming writer shows us the structure of ice flowers.
He describes a snow shower as a “shower of frozen flowers.” “When snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</a></span>
is produced in calm air,” he says, “the icy particles build themselves into
stellar shapes, each star possessing six rays.” We annex some drawings of
snow crystals, which are, indeed, wonderfully made. Hear Professor Tyndall
once again:—</p>

<p>“Let us imagine the eye gifted with a microscopic power sufficient to
enable us to see the molecules which compose those starry crystals: to
observe the solid nucleus formed and floating in the air; to see it drawing
towards it its allied atoms, and these arranging themselves as if they moved
to music, and ended by rendering that music concrete.” This “six-rayed
star” is typical of lake ice also.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_640a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 722.—Ice crystal.</div>
</div>

<p>Snow sometimes reaches us in a partly melted condition; under these
circumstances it is called <em>sleet</em>, and snow being much lighter than rain (ice
is lighter than water), it descends less directly, and represents about one-tenth
the depth of the rain-fall. The use of snow in warming the earth is
universally acknowledged, and as it is such a bad conductor, a man in a snow
hut will soon become unpleasantly warm.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_640b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 723.—Ice crystal.</div>
</div>

<p>Ice is only water in another form, and snow is ice; and it is the air
in the snow that gives it warming properties. These are all simple facts,
which any one by observation and careful reading and study may soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span>
ascertain for himself. We have another frozen fall of water from the clouds—viz.,
hail, which may possibly be the development of <em>sleet</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hail</span> is formed by the falling rain being frozen in its descent, or when
different currents meet in the atmosphere. A hail-storm is accompanied with
a rushing sound, as if the hail-stones were striking against each other. They
are very destructive, and actual hail showers occur in summer more frequently
than in winter, and a peculiarity noticeable with regard to hail is its infrequent
occurrence during the night.</p>

<p>Records of destructive hail storms are plentiful. The hail assumes a
great size, weighing sometimes as much as two ounces, and measuring several
inches round. Thunder and lightning are very frequent accompaniments of
hail showers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dew</span> is moisture of the atmosphere deposited on a cool surface—another
form of condensation, in fact. Cold water in a tumbler will
produce a “dew” upon the <em>outside</em> of the glass when carried into a warm
atmosphere. Such is the dew upon the grass. It is produced by the air
depositing moisture as it becomes colder after a warm day when much
vapour was absorbed. Warm air can hold more water than cold air, and,
the saturation point being reached, the excess falls as <em>dew</em> at the dew (or
saturation) point. We have previously remarked that one use of clouds was
to prevent rapid radiation of heat which they keep below. Under these
circumstances—viz., when a night is cloudy—we shall find much less dew
upon the grass than when a night has been quite clear, because the heat has
left the atmosphere for the higher regions, and has then been kept down
by the clouds; but on a clear night the air has become cooled rapidly
by radiation, and having arrived at saturation point, condensation takes place.</p>

<p>Dew does not <em>fall</em>, it is deposited; and may be more or less according
to circumstances, for shelter impedes the radiation, and some objects radiate
less heat than others. Hence some objects will be covered with dew and
others scarcely wetted.</p>

<p>When the temperature of the air is very low,—down to freezing point,—the
particles of moisture become frozen, and appear as <em>hoar-frost</em> upon the
ground. Thus dew and hoar-frost are the same thing under different
atmospheric conditions, as are water and ice and vapour.</p>

<p>We have now come round again almost to whence we started. We
have seen the land and water, and the parts that water, in its various forms,
plays upon the land, and its effects in the air as rain, etc. We have noticed
the winds and air currents as well as the ocean and its currents. We know
what becomes of rain and how it is produced, and how the sea works upon
the shore, and how clouds benefit us. There are besides some less common
phenomena which we will now proceed to examine.</p>

<p>There are a great number of interesting, and to inhabitants of these
islands uncommon,—perhaps we might say fortunately uncommon,—phenomena,
which overtake the traveller in other countries. We have referred to
whirlwinds and tornados, and will now mention two phenomena connected
with these storms. There is the water-spout, for instance, and sand-pillars
in the desert, which are whirled up by these winds in spiral columns of
water and sand respectively. The tiny whirlwind at cross-roads, which picks
up straws and leaves, is the common appearance of whirling or crossing
currents of air.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">Fig. 724.—The Waterspout.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span></p>

<p>Waterspouts, when they are permitted to come near a ship at sea, or
when they break upon land, which is seldom, are very destructive. The
waterspout is begun generally by the agitation of the sea, and the cloud
above drops to meet the water, which at last unites with it, and then the
column of whirling liquid, tremendously disturbed at the base, advances
with the prevailing wind. Its course is frequently changed, and ships
within its influence would be speedily wrecked. The only way to save the
vessel is to fire a cannon ball through the column and break it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_643.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 725.—Thunderstorm and shower of ashes from Vesuvius.</div>
</div>

<p>A waterspout once devastated a district in the Hartz mountains of
Saxony. “A long tube of vapour descended to the earth, and several times
was drawn upward again; but at last it reached the ground, and travelled
along at the rate of four-and-a-half miles in eight minutes, destroying everything
in its way.”</p>

<p>On another occasion at Carcassonne in 1826, “a reddish column was
seen descending to the ground, and a young man was caught up by it and
dashed against a rock.” His death was instantaneous.</p>

<p>The cause of these whirling winds is supposed to be in the action of
vertical currents of air which ascend heated, and return rapidly as cold air.
The “waterspouts,” etc., are quickly formed. The tornado is a monster
whirlwind like a waterspout in form, and advances at a tremendous rate—eastward
as a rule. It moves in leaps and bounds, passing over some portions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</a></span>
of the ground and descending again. The current of air is directed to the
centre; the cyclone, as mentioned, has a spiral or rotatory movement.</p>

<p>Thunder and lightning have been, to some extent, described under the
head of <span class="smcap">Electricity</span>, but some observations may also be introduced here, as
storms of that nature appertain to meteorology distinctly.</p>

<p>Electricity is always present in the atmosphere, and arises from evaporation
and condensation as well as from plants. As the air becomes moist,
the intensity of the so-called “fluid” increases, and more in winter than in
summer. Clear skies are positively electric, and when large, heavy clouds
are perceived in process of formation in a sky up to that time clear, a storm
is almost certain to follow. These “thunder clouds,” in which a quantity of
electricity exists, attract or repel each other respectively. The cloud attracts
the opposite kind of electricity to that within it; and when at last a tremendous
amount has been stored up in the cloud and in the air, or in another
cloud, the different kinds seek each other, and lightning is the result, accompanied
by a reverberation and commotion of the air strata, called thunder.</p>

<p>Lightning most frequently darts from cloud to cloud, but often strikes
the ground, whereon and in which are good conductors, such as wet trees,
metals, running water, etc. The “electric fluid” assumes different forms—“forked,”
“sheet,” and “globular.” The second is perhaps the most familiar
to us, and the third kind is the least known of all. There are many well-authenticated
instances on record in which lightning with the form and
appearance of fireballs has entered or struck houses and ships.</p>

<p>“Fulgarites” are vitreous tubes formed in sandy soils by the lightning
in search of subterranean water-courses, for running water is a great conductor
of electricity.<a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> The fire-ball form of lightning has been known to enter a
school-house where a number of children were, and to singe the garments of
some, killing others. The ball passed out through a pane of glass, in which it
bored a hole, breaking every other pane, however, in its transit. Another
instance occurred in which the lightning ran about the floor of a room, and
descending the stairs, exploded without doing any injury.</p>

<p>Lightning, like the electric current of the laboratory, will not always
set fire even to inflammable objects. An electric spark can be passed
through gunpowder without setting fire to it, and lightning will often shatter
the object without firing it. Death by lightning is instantaneous, and in all
probability quite painless; for we may argue from analogy, that as those who
have been rendered insensible by lightning have had no remembrance of
seeing the flash which strikes so instantaneously, nor of hearing thunder after
it, it is instantaneous in its effects. Besides, the natural attitude is preserved,
and the face is usually peaceful and limbs uncontorted after death by lightning.</p>

<p>There are some curious electrical phenomena, such as St. Elmo’s Fire,
already noticed under <span class="smcap">Electricity</span>; and in some parts of America, in very hot
weather, such a light is perceived to issue from trees as the fire glides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span>
through the forest. Many instances are on record concerning the luminosity
of pointed sticks, and even of the tails and manes of horses in certain conditions
of the atmosphere, and of the universal power of electricity and its pervading
influence in nature. The benefits conferred by thunderstorms in purifying
the air, and in the production of ozone and nitric acid, are very great, and
apart from the magnificent phenomena exhibited, are well worth our attention,
though beyond our reach.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_645.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 726.—Aurora Borealis.</div>
</div>

<p>Terrestrial magnetism, however, is still more puzzling in its action than is
electricity, and the study of the needle, its destination, inclination, and
intensity, which are marked upon charts, just as are the weather reports of the
<cite>Times</cite>, is an interesting one. These magnetic maps are termed the charts of
<span class="smcap">Isoclinic</span> and <span class="smcap">Isodynamic</span> lines. The declination of the magnetic needle from
the <em>true</em> north is its <em>deviation</em> from that point, and the “inclination” is its dip
towards the horizon. The line of its direction being known as the magnetic
meridian, its divergence from this line constitutes its declination. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span>
places where it does not deviate, and these, in direction north and south,
are called lines of “no variation.” There are also places in the equatorial
regions where the needle does not “dip.” The line connecting such places
is termed the Magnetic Equator, and north or south of this the needle dips
respectively to north or south in degrees coinciding with the distance from
the equator.</p>

<p>The earth, then, acts as a magnet, and attracts the needle, but the magnetic
poles are not identical with the terrestrial poles. The north magnetic
pole was reached in 1831 by Sir James Ross, when the dip was only one
minute less than 90°, and the south magnetic pole was very nearly reached
also by him in 1840. The magnetic equator passes between these two
points.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 727.—Paraselenæ, or mock moons.</div>
</div>

<p>It is to magnetic atmospherical disturbance that the aurora is due.
These northern (or southern) phenomena are extremely brilliant and diversified.
In temperate regions the aurora does not present such grand forms as
in the extreme north. There the spectacle is astonishingly beautiful. The
sky at first clouds over, and mist is developed. Humboldt has eloquently
described the aurora borealis, and the beautiful changes of light, the constant
movement, flashes, etc., denoting a “magnetic” storm, as electrical discharges
indicate an electric storm, although the area affected by the former
is far more extensive than that of the latter, and there is no thunder accompanying
the magnetic storm, with the production of which the electricity of
the earth is unassociated. To the continuous flow of this electricity the
aurora is due, and the flashes are only the electric current descending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</a></span>
towards the earth. But the true reason of the phenomena may have to be
yet discovered, for nothing absolutely certain is known as to the origin of
the aurora.</p>

<p>Amongst the numerous effects of refraction and reflection of light the
<span class="smcap">Rainbow</span> is most common and the most beautiful. If we hold a chandelier
“drop” in the sunlight, we shall see a brilliant representation of the rainbow
on the wall or on the carpet. The three colours—red, yellow, and blue—mingle
or shade away into seven—red, orange, green, blue, yellow, indigo,
and violet. These colours are all found in the rainbow.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_647.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 728.—Parhelia, or mock suns.</div>
</div>

<p>The colour of the atmosphere—the usual blue tint of the sky—arises
from the blue rays of the spectrum being reflected more than the rest by the
aerial particles, and the less vapour the bluer the sky, because the vapour
gives it a whitish or misty tint. At sunset and sunrise the sky is red or
yellow, like gold, or of crimson hue. This is because the sun’s rays have so
much farther to come to us at sunrise or sunset, as you will readily perceive
if you draw a line from the sun to the sides and then to the top of the arc
of the heavens. The blue rays are thus lost in space, while red and yellow,
which travel so much faster than blue, are transmitted to the eye, not
giving the air time to absorb them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[Pg 648]</a></span></p>

<p>If you go under water and look at the sun it will appear very fiery
indeed, and we may likewise imagine that fiery crimson rays, which betoken
atmospherical disturbance, very often are due to the moisture through which
they are transmitted. Wet and storm frequently succeed a crimson sunset,
which betokens much moisture in the air. The sun is similarly seen through
the steam issuing from an engine, and the colours vary according to the
density of the steam in its stages of condensation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_648.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 729.—Mirage at sea.</div>
</div>

<p>Vapour, we know, is invisible and transparent, but when it has been
condensed into rain-drops, and the sun is shining, if we stand with our backs
to the sun we see what we call the rainbow, because a ray of light entering
the drop is reflected, and as all rays are not of equal refrangibility, the light,
which is composed of three simple rays, is divided and reflected into those and
the complementary colours. When the sun is at the horizon, the rainbow, to
an observer on the earth (but not on a mountain), will appear to be a semi-circle.
The higher the sun rises the lower is the centre of the rainbow. So
we can never see rainbows at noon in summer because the sun is too high.
A second rainbow is not uncommon, the second reflection producing the
colours in a different order. The colours in the “original” range from violet
to red; in the “copy” they extend from red to violet. “Rainbows” are
often visible in the spray of waterfalls and fountains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halos</span> are frequently observed surrounding the moon, and then we are
apt to prognosticate rain.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The nearer the wane</div>
<div class="verse">The farther the rain,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>is an old couplet referring to the appearance of the moon, and is supposed to
foreshadow the weather by the size of the halo, which is caused, as we know,
by the existence of vesicular vapour in the atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mock Suns</span>, or <em>parhelia</em>, and mock-moons, or <em>paraselenæ</em>, are continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[Pg 649]</a></span>
observed in cold climates, where the tiny ice particles are so abundant in the
air. These phenomena were recognized by the ancients, and halos round
the sun can be observed by means of darkened glasses. We annex an
illustration of a mock sun and moon seen on the continent of Europe.
Readers of Mr. Whymper’s “Scrambles in the Alps” will remember the
gorgeous, and to the guides mysterious, fog-bow or sun-bow seen as the
survivors of the first and most fatal ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865 were
tremblingly pursuing their descent over the upper rocks of that mountain.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Mirage</span>, or <em>Fata Morgana</em>, is a very curious but sufficiently
common phenomena, and in the Asiatic and African plains it is frequently
observed. When the weather is calm and the ground hot, the Egyptian
landscape appears like a lake, and the houses look like islands in the midst
of a widely-spreading expanse of water. This causes the <em>mirage</em>, which is
the result of evaporation, while the different temperatures of the air strata
cause an unequal reflection and refraction of light, which give rise to the
mirage. Travellers are frequently deceived, but the camels will not quicken
their usual pace until they scent water.</p>

<p>The Fata Morgana and the inverted images of ships seen at sea are
not uncommon on European coasts. Between Sicily and Italy this effect is
seen in the Sea of Reggio with fine effect. Palaces, towers, fertile plains,
with cattle grazing on them, are seen, with many other terrestrial objects,
upon the sea—the palaces of the Fairy Morgana. The inverted images of
ships are frequently perceived as shown in the illustration (fig. 729), and
many most extraordinary but perfectly authentic tales have been related concerning
the reflection and refraction of persons and objects in the sky and
on land, when no human beings nor any of the actual objects were within
the range of vision.</p>

<p>It will be well to explain this phenomenon, and the diagrams will
materially assist us in so doing, for the appearances are certainly startling
when realized for the first time. The Spectre of the Brocken we see mimics
our movements, and we can understand it. But when apparently solid
buildings appear where no buildings have been erected,—when we see—as
has been perceived—soldiers riding across a mountain by a path, or ledge,
perfectly inaccessible to human beings even on foot, we hesitate, and think
there is something uncanny in the sight. Let us now endeavour to explain
the mirage.</p>

<p>Suppose that in the annexed diagram the space enclosed between the
letters <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>, be a glass vessel full of water. The ship is below the
horizon, the eye being situated at <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>—the glass vessel of course representing
the atmosphere charged with moisture. The eye at <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> will perceive the top
of the mast of the ship, <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, and we may imagine a line drawn from <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>.
Then put a (short focus) convex lens at <i>a</i> just above this (imaginary) line,
and a concave one, <i>b</i>, just over it. Through the former an inverted ship
will be seen, and an erect one through the latter at <span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">S″</span> respectively.
We now have the effect in the air just as reproduced in nature by the dif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span>ference
in temperature in air strata, which cause it to act like a concave lens
when the density of the water
diminishes towards the centre,
and like a convex lens when it
is increased.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_650a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 730.—Explanation of Mirage.</div>
</div>

<p>This can be proved by
heating the air (by hot irons)
above the glass vessel filled
with oil, and the effects will
be just the same as through the lenses. Dr. Wollaston obtained the
mirage by using a clear syrup,—about one-third of the vessel full,—and
filling it with water. The gradual
mingling of these fluids will
produce the phenomenon. The
illustration in the margin (fig.
731) shows us the rays proceeding
from the ship’s hull, and refracted
into the line reaching the
eye, above the line proceeding
from the mast, so the ship appears
hull uppermost; the rays
cross at <i>x</i>. But if they did not
cross before they reach the eye, the image would appear as at <i>s´</i> <i>p´</i> in an
erect position.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_650b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 731.—The Mirage.</div>
</div>

<p>The Spectre of the Brocken arises from a different cause. Such appearances
are only shadows,—projected on thin clouds or dense vapours at
sunrise, or when the sun’s rays are directed horizontally,—for of course
vertical rays will throw the shadow on the ground on to the zenith. Balloons
are also reflected thus, and much interest has been caused by the
appearance of a twin balloon, until the aerial voyagers have discovered the
cheat by seeing the shadowy aeronaut imitating their actions, and the second
balloon has been discovered to be an airy nothing.</p>

<p class="hang">WEATHER, CLIMATE, AND TEMPERATURE—ISOTHERMAL LINES—ISOBARS,
WEATHER FORECASTS, AND SIGNS OF THE SKY.</p>


<p>It is usually considered a sign of a paucity of ideas when one begins a
conversation about the “weather,” but there can be no doubt that there is
no more interesting question in social life at certain times as to whether it
will or will not rain. Our outdoor amusements are all dependent upon
weather, and a little cloud may throw a deep shadow over all our pleasure if
we neglect to bring out an umbrella, or to carry a waterproof. We are
never independent of what we term the “capricious” climate, but in reality
the laws of “the Weather,” though so imperfectly understood, are fixed
and invariable, and if we could read the signs in the sky and learn the
condition of the atmosphere, we might leave the “prayers for rain” and “for
fine weather” out of the Church service, for then we should understand
that unless miracles are performed for us the laws of Nature can in no wise
be altered.</p>

<p>Of late years weather forecasts (not prophecies) have come before us in
our newspapers after the manner instituted by the late Admiral Fitzroy,
whose name has become a household word in England. But at the commencement
of the Christian era and before that time the signs of the
heavens and the behaviour of animals and birds were noted with reference
to changes of weather. If we read Virgil we shall find numerous references
to these portents, and the translation usually quoted will furnish us with information
which must be as true nowadays as it was in Virgil’s time, for wild
animals do not change their habits. Speaking of wet weather in the
Georgics the poet wrote:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The wary crane foresees it first, and sails</div>
<div class="verse">Above the storm, and leaves the hollow vales;</div>

<div class="verse">The change of heaven, and sniffs it in the wind;</div>
<div class="verse">The swallow skims the river’s watery face,</div>
<div class="verse">The frogs renew the croaks of their loquacious race;</div>
<div class="verse">The careful ant her secret cell forsakes,</div>
<div class="verse">And draws her eggs along the narrow tracks;</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</a></span></p>
<p>We might quote further selections respecting the signs in the heaven
and earth mentioned, but the foregoing verses will be sufficient to illustrate
our position, and to show us that weather forecasting is, at any rate, as old as
the Christian era.</p>

<p>The moon is generally supposed to influence the weather—a “Saturday’s
Moon” being particularly objectionable, or when she appears anew at some
hours after midnight thus—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When first the moon appears, if then she shrouds</div>
<div class="verse">Her silver crescent, tipped with sable clouds,</div>
<div class="verse">Conclude she bodes a tempest on the main,</div>
<div class="verse">And brews for fields impetuous floods of rain.”</div>
</div></div></div>

</div>

<p>Weather permitting, we can go out and study the clouds as described
in the foregoing chapters, or consult the barometer, and see which way the
wind blows. The child will tell us that a high “glass” means fine weather,
and a low barometer indicates rain, but this is only relatively true. A high
glass may be falling, a low glass may be rising. A <em>sudden</em> fall or a <em>sudden</em>
rise are indicative of bad, windy weather, or a short-lived fine period.
The glass may rise with a northerly wind, and rain will supervene, so careful
observation is necessary before one can obtain even a superficial knowledge of
the weather. (See subsequent observations on “Weather.”)</p>

<p>The Americans telegraph the results of their observations of coming
storms across the Continent, corrected by the signs noticed and recorded by
vessels arriving in New York. Thus they are frequently very accurate;
steady application and observation at Sandy Hook must give them a great
deal of useful information for the “forecasts.”</p>

<p>The word <span class="smcap">Climate</span> is derived from the Greek <i lang="el">klima</i>, a slope; and thus at
a glance we perceive how the aspect it presents to the rays of the sun in the
earth’s revolutions, must affect the “climate” of a country. Of course the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[Pg 653]</a></span>
position of any portion, the elevation and locality of the mountains, have
also a share with the soil, winds, rains, and sea-board, in determining the
climate of any region. Many points have already been touched upon in
former chapters. Temperature, moisture, and vegetation are the chief
natural features which determine climate, and we must find out the position
of the land with reference to the sun first, to ascertain the <em>climate</em>.</p>

<p>The more vertical the sun is the hotter the atmosphere, for the rays
strike directly upon the earth, which radiates the warmth received. These
heat rays are, as we know, invisible. The hottest portion of the earth
must be at the equator for the sun is overhead, and the rays beat down
directly upon the earth. The sun is also nearer than when at the horizon,
and less rays are absorbed by the atmosphere. The longer the day the
greater the heat.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_653.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 733.—In the southern steppes.</div>
</div>

<p>Temperature is registered by observation of the thermometer, and the
distribution of heat is represented upon a chart across which lines are drawn
at places of equal temperature. These lines are called “isothermal.” There
are also terms to denote equal winter temperature and the average summer
heat—<em>isochimines</em> and <em>isotheres</em> respectively.</p>

<p>Temperature decreases as we ascend from, and increases as we descend
into, the earth. This fact proves that the air is not warmed by the sun’s
heat, but by radiation from the ground. As we ascend we reach the line of
perpetual snow, which varies in different parts of the globe. In the tropics
it extends from 15,000 to 18,000 feet; but it varies even in places of the
same latitude, according as the towns are inland or on the coast, as in the
Pyrenees and Caucasus, where there is a difference of three thousand feet in
the snow limit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</a></span></p>

<p>The line of the snow limit, as a rule, gets lower as we journey from
the equator to the poles. Exception will be found in the Himâlaya, where
the snow line is higher on the northern side, in consequence of the existence
of the Thibetan tableland, which causes a higher temperature than that
existing upon the abrupt southern slope. Countries, therefore, though in
the same latitude, may have different climates according to the elevation of
the land.</p>

<p>The proximity to the sea is another reason for climatic difference.
Water takes some time to become warm, but when it has once become so it
will not readily part with its heat. The Gulf Stream, with its warm current
beating along our shores, gives us a high temperature and a moist climate—a
very different condition to Newfoundland or Nova Scotia, which are in
much the same latitude as England and Ireland. By the sea the climate is
more uniform, and the extremes of heat and cold are not so distant. We
send invalids to the seaside to save them the effects of such violent changes.
Winters are milder and summers cooler by the sea.</p>

<p>We can readily understand how such circumstances affect the vegetation,
and places which in winter may enjoy a mild and genial climate (comparatively
speaking), may have a cold summer. Ferns may flourish in winter
out of doors, but wheat will not ripen in the autumn owing to the want of
heat.</p>

<p>The winds also, and the soil and aspect of a region, all have a share in
determining its climate. Trees bring rain by evaporation, and a wooded
country is a blessing to its inhabitants, defending their habitations from
wind and avalanches in mountainous districts. But the climatic conditions
are altering. The ground is being more and more cleared; the soil is more
cultivated, and moisture is being more eliminated from it. Therefore the
air becomes warmer by the radiation of the ground, and clouds are formed
which keep the warm layers down nearer the earth. Mountains, as we have
seen, affect the rain-fall in districts; and in Scandinavia—in Norway chiefly—the
average rain-fall is very high. The sheltering effects of mountains
from east or northerly winds also alter the climate, while clay or gravel soils
are cold or warm inasmuch as they absorb, or evaporate, moisture. Some
surfaces being different from others give out more heat.</p>

<p>In some mountainous districts we shall find every variety of climate
from the sea-level tropical heat to the rigours of the pole. The greatest
average temperature is north of the equator in Africa; the lowest in the
north, to the west of Greenland. Masses of land act in a different manner
to the oceans, and the former become heated and cooled with equal rapidity,
while the sea, as already mentioned, is slow to lose its heat. Our land
enjoys a mild and equable climate as a rule, because it is surrounded by
water, and the Gulf Stream warms it. The European climate, taken altogether,
may be considered the best on the globe.</p>

<p>We will now pass on to a few observations concerning the weather, and
the means of determining it beforehand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</a></span></p>

<p>It is always a dangerous thing to act the part of a prophet, and the
uncertainty attending an uninspired foreteller’s predictions must in time
disparage him in the estimation of his hearers and disciples. But there
are signs in the sky which we can discern and render valuable by the aid of
instruments. We must have a reliable barometer and thermometer, and
keep a record of the average conditions of the weather, if we wish to wear
the mantle of the weather-prophet—a term now, in America, applied
(jokingly, no doubt) to people who are not particular in their statements
of facts.</p>

<p>But without entering upon any scientific discussion, we may state a few
plain rules which can be observed, besides the indications of a rising or falling
barometer. Having frequently studied the aspects of the clouds, with the
assistance of the hints from the wind-currents, we can fairly <em>prognosticate</em> or
suggest <em>probable</em> changes of weather.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">Fig. 734.—Weather chart.</div>
</div>

<p>We have already remarked upon the colours of the sunset, which are
attributable to the vapours in the atmosphere, and we say a red sky foretells
fine weather; a yellow sky changing into green means rain, or rain and wind;
on the other hand, when the red rays appear we may anticipate fine weather,
as the atmosphere is becoming less and less moist.</p>

<p>A “low” dawn is known as a good sign; so when the first rays appear
at, or near the horizon, we may anticipate a fine day, as we may when the
morning is grey.</p>

<p>
“Evening red and morning grey”<br />
</p>

<p>are almost unfailing tokens of fine weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[Pg 656]</a></span></p>

<p>Very often a yellow sunset means wind; a wild, crimson sky means a
gale. On the afternoon (Saturday) before the <i>Eurydice</i> foundered off the
Isle of Wight, we particularly noted the sunset at Gravesend; and it was evident
(in our estimation) that a sudden storm was imminent, and we remarked it
to our companions. The sudden fall of the barometer, and the appearance
of the rising clouds early on that sad Sunday afternoon, approaching in dark
masses from the west and north-west, spoke of rain and (possibly) snow.
How true the forecast was the event proved.</p>

<p>When clouds are soft and thin we expect fine weather; when they are
dark and hard, rain and wind. A ragged-edged and heavy cloud indicates
thunder and lightning, with squalls when we see dark clouds flying rapidly
across the mass of cumuli. A “mackerel” sky and “mares’ tails” generally
foretell wind, the direction and the upper currents being noted. The longer
the warning given by the heavens, the longer the bad (or fine) weather will
last; and the converse is also true.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Evening grey and morning red,</div>
<div class="verse">Put on your hat, you’ll wet your head.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The cirrus is a wispy cloud, and is often observed extending across the
sky on a fine afternoon. This may or may not indicate rain; it generally
points to wind. If its direction be northerly and west to southerly and east,
it is a good sign, but from west to east it is a bad sign. The habits of birds
and animals, and their anxiety for shelter, “pigs running with pieces of straw
in their mouths,” and the low-flying swallow, are all signs of approaching
rain and bad weather, and the scintillation of stars betokens moisture in
the atmosphere. These are well-known appearances, but there are others
regarding the winds and currents of air which require the assistance of
Admiral Fitzroy’s book.</p>

<p>For instance, a falling barometer with rising temperature means southerly
winds and rain; in winter, with low temperature, snow.</p>

<p>But a rising barometer with northerly wind often means rain.</p>

<p>A rising glass after a low fall may, and often does, indicate <em>more</em> wind
from the north, and after that fine weather, if lower temperature also supervene.
If warm weather continue under the circumstances, the wind may
back and blow from the southward.</p>

<p>“The most dangerous shifts of wind happen soon after the barometer
rises from a very low point, or if the wind veers gradually shortly after with
a rising barometer.”</p>

<p>If the barometer rises with a southerly wind fine weather may be
expected, and if it falls with a northerly wind rain, hail, and snow are imminent,
for the rule is a fall for southerly, and a rise for northerly winds.</p>

<p>A sudden fall with west wind indicates storm from northerly quarters
(N.E. to N.W.). An east gale veering southwards with falling glass indicates
a change of storm-direction to a point from N.W. or N.E., suddenly and
violently, though a change might have been expected from the appearance
of the glass. A calm frequently occurs between these disturbances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[Pg 657]</a></span></p>

<p>A backing wind—that is, a wind going in a direction opposed to the
sun’s course (and with the earth)—is a bad sign after unsettled weather. The
wind is said to “veer” when it goes <em>with</em> the sun.</p>

<p>The south-east wind, with clear sky, warm weather, and low clouds on
the horizon, is a sign of wet. A dry east wind means fine weather. Heavy
clouds in the north-west generally bring a thunderstorm. When really
distant objects look very near rain must be expected.</p>

<p>There are many exceptions to weather rules, and none can be laid down
as invariable. The ever-changing currents of air, and varying moisture of
the atmosphere, give rise to barometric changes, which should be carefully
noted. A little experience and close observation for one year, with notes of
signs, and indications of temperature, will assist any one to tell the probable
change that is approaching.</p>

<p>There are a great number of signs of weather which are observable
in the animal and even in the vegetable kingdom, as well as in the moon
and stars. Many flowers close their petals before rain comes on, and the
behaviour of domestic animals often foretells storm. Sheep huddling
together in a corner tell us the direction from which the tempest is approaching;
sea birds fly to shore, and land birds become restless.</p>

<p>The naturalist will observe the domestic animals which become
uncomfortable and sniff the air; the cat lies with her head down, the brain
lowest; and frequently washes her face, or scampers about aimlessly.
Spiders disappear, and worms come up to seek the expected water. When
fine weather is coming all nature appears glad, but leeches sink into the
water as far as they can.</p>

<p>The above are some of the domestic and common signs of coming
rain, and conversely for fine weather. A wailing wind, a cloudy mountain,
a greenish rainbow or too red a one, a pale moon with indistinct points,
or a halo round it, are all signs of rain and possibly wind. So the most
superficial observer may with these few suggestions inform himself of the
chances of fine or wet weather.</p>

<p class="hang">PLANTS AND ANIMALS—STRUCTURE OF PLANTS—FLOWERING PLANTS—THE

<p><span class="smcap">Biology</span> is derived from the Greek word <i lang="el">Bios</i>, “life,” and <i lang="el">logein</i>, “to speak,”
and constitutes the science of <span class="smcap">Organic Life</span>. This science is divided into
two branches: <span class="smcap">Botany</span>, relating to the life of plants; <span class="smcap">Zoology</span>, to the
animals.</p>

<p>Plants, then, are living things, and as we proceed we shall find them
born, or “germinating,” growing up as young plants, maturing as adults,
and finally dying, and their particles resolving into their elements. There
is more than one application of
the text, “Man is but as a flower
of the field.”</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Geological</span> section
we noticed the progressive stages
of the vegetable creation, and if
we turn back to those pages
wherein the various epochs of
the earth’s formation are enumerated,
we shall see how plant-life
developed. Thus we find in
the Cambrian the first traces of
vegetable life in the weeds of
primeval seas. The Silurian
strata and the Devonian furnish
us with many fossils of marine
algæ, and if we examine the succeeding
periods we shall find a
progressive increase and development;
pines and tree-ferns in the sandstone, and most of the plants (by
which term we include all varieties) were different from those at present
existing in the earth.</p>

<p>We spoke of climate lately, and referred to the vegetation having an
influence upon it. The same is true of the effect of climate upon vegetation.
The conditions of plant-life depend upon climate, as it partly depends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</a></span>
upon plant-life. But of all the necessary conditions the first created thing
is the most necessary—light. Without light the plant is nothing.</p>

<p>Plants have many points of similarity
with animals. They live, they possess organs,
their compositions contain similar substances,
such as carbon and albumen, and close chemical
analyses have found the existence of the elements
oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon
in animals and plants. Therefore water must
play a conspicuous part in all. Professor
Huxley puts this question in his usual clear
fashion. He says:—</p>

<p>“It is a very remarkable fact that not
only are such substances as albumen, gluten,
fibrin, and syntonin known exclusively as
products of animal and vegetable bodies, but
that every animal and every plant at all
periods of its existence contains one or other of them, though in other
respects the composition of living bodies may vary indefinitely. Thus some
plants contain neither starch nor cellulose, though these substances are found
in some animals; while many animals contain no horny matter and no
gelatine-yielding substance. So that the matter which appears to be the
<em>essential</em> foundation of both the animal and the plant, is the <em>proteid</em> united
with water, though it is probable that in all animals and plants these are
associated with more or less fatty and amyloid (starchy and saccharine)
substances, and with very small quantities of certain mineral bodies, of which
the most important appear to be phosphorus, iron, lime, and potash.
Thus there is a substance composed of
water, <em>plus</em> proteids, <em>plus</em> fat, <em>plus</em> amyloids,
<em>plus</em> mineral matters, which are found in
all animals and plants. When these are
alive this substance is termed <span class="smcap">Protoplasm</span>.”</p>

<p>We have taken the liberty to extract
the above paragraph, as it expresses in a
few words, and very clearly, the common
origin of plants and animals. We will now
consider the conditions of plant life. Heat,
light, and moisture are the principal necessaries,
with of course air and certain earthy
matter. Some plants, like some few animals,
live in darkness, such as truffles and
fungi, as do cave-fish and bats. But this
is the exception, and the sense in which plants (or animals) can exist without
light is a very restricted one, and only to be sustained at the expense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</a></span>
the plant material, which must originally have been derived by the action of
light. Light, therefore, is the great “producer.” It gives life to plants
upon which animals feed, and therefore light is in one sense the beginning of
all things. We can now understand why light must have been created first.</p>

<p>Many interesting experiments can be made to observe the effect of
darkness and different coloured light (transmitted through coloured glasses)
upon plants; and it will be observed that although the leaves may not
develop the natural green tint, the flowers will exhibit their usual colour.
One effect of light upon plants is to make them green.</p>

<p>We all admire the beautiful green of the spring leaves, and the freshness
of the colours of the trees and grass. But if we pluck up a plant its root is
not green. Why then is the cleaned root not as green as the upper
portion?—Because of the absence
of light. There is a
substance called <em>Chlorophyl</em>
which, <em>when acted upon by light,
becomes green</em>. This is contained
in plants, and when the
daylight falls upon it the substance
turns green. So, as we
said above, plants are not green
when kept in the dark. Celery
is a common instance. Heat,
of course, has much to do
with the activity or vitality of
plants, and the range extends
from just above freezing point
to 122° Fahr. We find tiny
plants blossoming in Alpine
regions close to the snow, and
others in full life in the tropics,
protected from the fierce rays
by scaly coverings and huge
leaves. In the northern regions buds appear as soon as the surface warmth
is felt, and even when no heat can yet penetrate to the roots. Thus we see
that Nature fits the animal and the plant to the localities in which they
live, and they exist interdependently. Some can defy cold, others flourish
in drought; some love moisture, others live in great heat encased in prickly
armour.</p>

<p>With this introduction to biology we may now pass on to speak of the
seeds and germination of plants, which we divide into the flowering and non-flowering
species. We suppose that the appearance of various organs of
plants are familiar to our readers, and the <em>root</em>, the <em>stem</em>, the <em>leaves</em>, and
the <em>flower</em> itself, as well as the <em>seeds</em>, are well known, and their uses understood
generally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[Pg 661]</a></span></p>

<p>Now if we compare a mineral—say a crystal of quartz—with a plant,
we find the crystal uniform, consisting of small particles of quartz throughout,
and it appears an aggregation from outside of these particles in a
particular form. It cannot grow from within. But a plant can; and it is
very different in structure and appearance. It receives nourishment from
outside also, but it <em>assimilates</em> the materials, which are not the same as those
we meet with in the plant itself. The mineral, on the contrary, is essentially
the same throughout; it can only grow by aggregation of atoms like itself.
A plant, therefore, like an animal, must have organs within it, and must be
capable of change in itself; it has powers of reproduction, and in some few
instances of locomotion; it can eat flies, and assimilate them as an animal
does.</p>

<p>A plant, therefore, is an organized body without external voluntary
movement; and hereby it is essentially distinct from an <em>animal</em>, with which,
in organization, it is closely connected. The simplest form of the animal
as of the plant, is that of a minute vesicle or cell, containing a fluid in
which are some granular substances. At this stage it could not be distinguished
from the simplest plant, if it had not the faculty of voluntary
movement—the power of changing its place. The animal has a locomotive
power. Sometimes, indeed, it is a very limited sphere to which it is confined;
yet it may change its place for another more conducive to the
exigencies of its being.</p>

<p>It is sufficient for the present to have given the most general characteristics
by which plants are distinguished from the other objects that, with
them, compose the great kingdom of Nature. A precise and clear apprehension
of their varied forms and wonderful phenomena can only be obtained
by a careful analysis of the nature and structure of the subjects of the vegetable
kingdom.</p>

<p>The <em>cell</em> is the fundamental or elementary organ of plants, and the
knowledge of its metamorphoses and functions constitutes the foundation
of botany. We must therefore first consider the simple organs of plants.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Structure of Plants.</span></p>

<p>It will be necessary for the reader to gain some little knowledge of the
tissues and cells of plants before he proceeds to examine the organs of
development, and a microscopic examination will soon disclose the few simple
tissues which are termed cells and vessels. These exist in all plants of
whatever nature. Plants are aggregations of cells, “every one of which has
its little particle of <em>protoplasm</em> enclosed by a casing of the substance called
<em>cellulose</em>, a non-nitrogenous substance nearly allied in chemical composition
to starch.”<a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> The tissues are “cellular” and “vascular” respectively.</p>

<p>The cells have an outer <em>sac</em> or covering which is transparent, and this
cover is the <em>cellulose</em> above mentioned. It contains (1) the <em>protoplasm</em>, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[Pg 662]</a></span>
kind of jelly-like substance (which holds the proteine or basis of life);
(2) water or cell-sap; (3) the nucleus; and (4) chlorophyl. This
protoplasm is apparent in both
plants and animals. The cells containing
these various substances—in
which we find oxygen, hydrogen,
nitrogen, sulphur, and carbon, with
phosphorus perhaps—are divided
to form new cells, and so on with
most astonishing rapidity, amounting
in some instances to millions in a
day, and a case of this nature will readily be recognized in the mushroom.</p>

<div class="caption"> A &nbsp; &nbsp; B &nbsp; &nbsp; C<br />Fig. 739.—Plant cells.</div>
</div>

<p><em>Cellular tissue</em> is composed of these cells, and <em>vascular tissue</em> is composed of
vessels or tubes like coiled springs, which are cells without divisions or partitions.
These tissues will be referred to farther on as dotted ducts or tubes.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_662b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 740—Form of cells.</div>
</div>

<p>In most of the spongy parts of plants, as in the pulp of fruits and pith of
elder, the cells preserve the globular or oval shape represented in fig. 739 <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>.
But the cells, in consequence of that mutual pressure, more frequently assume
the form of a polygon (fig. 739 <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>), the section of which is generally hexagonal.
The cellular tissue may generally be compared to the bubbles produced by
blowing through a straw or tobacco-pipe into soap and water; or it may be
illustrated by placing balls of moist clay together, and then pressing them
more or less strongly. In this manner every individual ball
assumes a polygonal shape corresponding to the form of the cells
represented in fig. 739 <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, and which disposition is, in many plants,
preserved with the utmost regularity. Such cells as are, with
tolerable equality, extended in all directions, are named <em>parenchyma</em>,
and of these are composed the tuberous parts of plants, as the
potato, dahlia-roots, etc., and especially the soft, spongy parts of
the pith, bark, leaves, etc. We frequently, however, meet with cells
which are extended longitudinally, and pointed at both extremities,
as in fig. 740. The sections of these cells, which are compactly
arranged, have the appearance of a hexagon. They are
termed <em>woody cells</em>, or <em>woody tissue</em> (prosenchyma), and constitute
the chief portions of the more solid parts of plants, as
the ligneous parts of trees, shrubs, etc. Very long, flexible cells,
as those which constitute the fibres of flax and hemp, are called
<em>bast-cells</em>, and appear under the microscope as round threads of
uniform thickness, whereas the fibres of cotton wool, which
rarely exceed one or two inches in length, when magnified, present
the appearance of flattish bands with somewhat rounded margins. By these
marks, the union of flax and cotton in the same web or piece of cloth may
be detected.</p>

<p>Occasionally the cells assume very abnormal shapes, as the stellate or
star-formed cells. These are described as <em>irregular cells</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[Pg 663]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 741.—Vascular tissue.</div>
</div>

<p>As every plant, whether small or great, is only an aggregate of a great
number of cells, so, also, the life of a plant is
nothing else but the sum of the activities of all
the cells of which it is composed. The special
province of the cells is to receive from the soil or
atmosphere the water necessary for the various
vegetative purposes, together with the nutritious
materials dissolved in the watery and aerial fluids,
and to circulate them through the whole body of
the plant. The circulation within a plant is
not carried on through the agency of tubular
channels, but only by the passage of sap in all
directions from one cell to another.</p>

<p>Since the cells have no openings, it is somewhat
difficult to understand in what manner the fluid can enter into the
plant from without, and by what means it can inwardly pass from cell to cell.
This phenomenon, however, is dependent on the peculiar quality both of
vegetable and animal membranes and fibres—viz., that they are permeable by
many fluids, without being dissolved by them. Experiments show that this
permeative action is carried on in accordance with definite laws. When two
fluids of <em>unequal densities</em>—as, for example, an aqueous solution of sugar and
mere water—are separated from each other by a diaphragm of pig’s bladder,
we perceive a constant tendency on both sides to restore the equilibrium in
the density of the two fluids. A portion of the water penetrates the bladder,
mixing with the solution, and a portion of the latter finds its way to the
former by the same medium. In this experiment one important fact is to
be observed—viz., that the lighter fluid always passes through the separating
medium more rapidly to the denser than <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>; consequently, in this
experiment more of the water passes through the bladder to the saccharine
solution than of the latter to the water. This permeative capability of the
tissue of vegetables and animals is called <em>endosmose</em>.</p>

<p>The cells both circulate the sap and alter its condition, so we find
differing substances in the same plant. The cell as described creates
new cells, and the force with which the
sap rises is rather greater than the pressure of
the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The vascular, or fibrous tissues, are illustrated
in the margin (fig. 741). They usually
contain air. Some plants have no vascular
tissue, and are termed cellular plants—such as
mushrooms, fungi, mosses, and seaweeds. Many contain both tissues, and
these are the more highly developed kinds.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 742.—Cells of epidermis (leaf).</div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes we find a milky juice in plants. This is called <em>latex</em>; and caoutchouc
is always present in it. This juice is contained in tiny tubular vessels,
which have their origin in the new cellular tissue of the lactiferous plants.</p>

<img src="images/i_664a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 743.—Stomata.</div>
</div>

<p>The tissue of the cuticle, or <em>epidermis</em>, which externally covers all parts
of the plant while they remain green, is of a peculiar nature, and demands
special consideration. It is formed of flat tubular
cells, very much compressed, and in close contact,
with the exception of some parts where the <em>stomata</em>,
or mouths, are placed. In fig. 742 a section of
the leaf is represented, the large transparent empty
cells of the epidermis, and above these the parenchymatous
cells of the leaf filled with greenish-coloured
granules. In four places (fig. 743) stomata
(<i>s s s s</i>) are seen, which have their openings surrounded
by parenchymatous cells disposed in semilunar forms. Under each
stoma (mouth) there is a hollow space which is connected with the intercellular
passages of the leaf. These stomata, represented in fig. 743, are so
numerous on the under side of the leaf, that hundreds have been counted in
the space of a square line. Through these minute organs an intimate connection
exists between the interior of the plant and the external air.</p>

<p>The epidermal cells not unfrequently exhibit very abnormal formations.
When much extended in length they appear as <em>hairs</em> which are frequently
branched, and in many plants they contain an irritating sap (in the nettle,
for example). Bristles, prickles, glands, warts, and especially the substance
which forms the well-known cork, are all due to the metamorphosis of this
exterior integument.</p>

<p>Flowering plants have certain distinct features which cannot be mistaken,
for they grow well above ground, and can easily be examined. There are a
hundred-thousand different species of flowering plants, and a visitor to Kew
can study them there. Any child can tell a flower when he sees it, but a
<em>flowering plant</em> is no more restricted in <span class="smcap">Botany</span> to actual bright blossoming
plants, than the term <em>rock</em> in <span class="smcap">Geology</span> means a mass of stone only.
Flowering plants may be either very gorgeous or very simple; and so
long as <em>they contain a reproductive apparatus</em> they are flowering plants. The
rose is a flowering plant, but the oak is equally one. The beech tree and
the primrose are classed under the same heading.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 747.—Tetradynamous stamens.</div>
</div>

<p>Flowering plants must possess <em>stamens</em> and <em>pistils</em>, which bring forth
<em>seeds</em> which contain an embryo, and the germination of seeds can be easily
perceived by any one who will take the
trouble to soak them (say “scarlet runners”)
in warm water, and keep them warm in
moist flannel. The process may then be
examined at leisure.</p>

<p>We need hardly insist, after what we
have said, upon the necessity for some air and
light, or remind the reader that he must not
keep the seeds in a close, dark place, though
light is not so necessary at first as air. The
embryo connects the “cotyledons” or halves
of the seed, and this develops into a tiny
rootlet or “radicle,” and upwards into the
stem, the commencement of which is known in botany as a “plumule.”
The rootlet seeks nourishment from the ground. The albumen secreted in
the cotyledons feeds the embryo, until (in some cases) it is
exhausted and they die away. In other cases they
grow up and obtain food for the young plant in the air.
Some plants have (like wheat) only one seed-leaf,
or cotyledon; and these kinds are called monocotyledons,
or <em>endogens</em>, in which the growth is upright.
The others are called dicotyledons, or <em>exogens</em>.</p>

<p>So far now, perhaps, you may understand that
the outer covering of the seed is called the <em>testa</em>;
the opening which may be perceived in the ordinary
bean near the dark spot is the <em>micropyle</em>, or little
gate; that the halves of the covering are termed <em>cotyledons</em>, or cups,
and that the embryo sprouts upwards and downwards, the upper
part of the stem being the plumule, and the lower portion the radicle.
Even if the seed be put micropyle upwards into the
ground, or between layers of flannel, to
germinate, you will find that the radicle
will always curve <em>downwards</em>.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 751.—Fibrous
root.</div>
</div>

<p>The root then being displayed, it
pushes its way into the ground to seek
for nourishment, and when the proper
moisture has been admitted to the seedling,
which has been reposing in the cotyledons
all the time, it sprouts up rapidly.
The root and its fibrous extremities have
been pushing and insinuating themselves
into and through the ground, and by small knobs or suckers known as
<em>spongioles</em>, the rootlets or fibrous parts of the root pick up sustenance for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[Pg 666]</a></span>
the plant, and it is then carried by tubes to the root, and so on throughout
the plant, and with air ducts serve to keep the plant alive.</p>

<p>The stem emanates from the <em>plumule</em>, and in
a short time little knots develop upon it, which
are the incipient leaves. The knots are divided
into nodes and internodes, because they appear
on different sides of the stem and intermediate, so
as to alternate with each other, and are really buds.
The issues unite also into leaf-stalks or <em>petioles</em>,
and extend into the leaf-frame or skeleton as we
see it when the leaf has decayed. So thus we
have an upward and a descending growth, which
respectively constitute the stem and root of a
flowering plant.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 752.—Tuberous (fasciculated) root.</div>
</div>

<p>Some trees have roots growing from the stem,
as in the banyan tree, and roots can produce
stems as well as the latter can form roots. The
uses of roots are so well understood that we need not particularize them. In
many trees we find what are termed <em>lenticellæ</em>, like holes in the bark. These
fissures will put forth roots under favourable circumstances. These stem
roots are called adventitious, and by taking “cuttings” from plants we
make good use of them for propagation.</p>

<p>But there are underground stems as well as those which flourish and
climb above it. “Bulbs” and “tubers” are common instances of these
underground stems, or “rhizoma,” which are horizontal. The ordinary stems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[Pg 667]</a></span>
are termed “aerial” stems to distinguish them from the earthy and subterranean.
The aerial roots of ivy are only used for support, and are not its
proper roots, though some parasitic plants strike
into the trees and are nourished by them.</p>

<p>The stem is that portion of the plant-axis
which grows upwards or above ground, and may
be, as we have just read, subterranean. As the
great function of the root is to procure sustenance
for the plant, the stem assists in carrying the nourishment
through the branches and leaves. We shall
find two forms of stem—the underground, or root-stock,
and the stem proper. There are in these two former several varieties
as under:—</p>

<p>1. The <span class="smcap">Bulb</span>, which is a short globular stem surrounded by thick
leaves, and producing
buds—as, for example,
the onion.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 755.—Section (magnified portion) of the small cut <i>a</i>.</div>

<p>2. The <span class="smcap">Tuber</span>,
similar to the foregoing
in shape, having no
leaves, however; the potato
is an instance.</p>

<p>3. The <span class="smcap">Rhizome</span>
(root-stock), like a root
only producing buds,
which roots do not. The
iris will serve as an example.</p>

<p>The varieties of the stem-proper are:—</p>

<p>(1) <em>Filiform</em>, or thread-like, simple, or branched, as in mosses.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_667c.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 756.—Section of an endogenous stem.</div>
</div>

<p class="hang">(2) The <em>culno</em>, a thin, hollow, and frequently-jointed
stem.</p>

<p class="hang">(3) The <em>palm</em> or simple stem, seen in tree-ferns
and palms. It is marked by the
scars of dropped leaves.</p>

<p class="hang">(4) The <em>stalk</em>, very common, of a green hue,
and its life is limited to a twelve-month
as a rule. The so-called
“stem” of the hyacinth is not a stem,
it is a stalk, or flower-stalk, pushed
forth for a temporary purpose.</p>

<p class="hang">(5) The <em>ligneous</em> stem is the perfected kind, and an example will be
apparent in every tree.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[Pg 668]</a></span></p>

<p>The duration of the stem of a plant is usually the same as of the plant—so
we have annuals, biennials, and perennials. The substance of the stem
determines its character, so we may have it solid, or soft, hollow, tubular,
flexible, rigid, or a tough stem. There are fibrous, herbaceous, and juicy
stems. They may be directed uprightly, straight, procumbently, arched, or
creeping, above, or underground, climbing, clinging, floating, or twining.</p>

<p>There are many plants with little or no stem deserving the name, as in
the onion; and we must all remember when studying botany that it is not
the <em>place</em> where a portion of a plant may be found that constitutes it a root
or a stem. The form and structure should be studied, and its purpose in
creation. So stems may be underground and roots above it. The root
and stem, briefly treated of in the foregoing paragraphs, have certain points
of resemblance, inasmuch as both consist of a main or trunk line, so to speak,
from which branches diverge as “rootlets” and “twigs”; and how beautiful
the latter are any one can see in a good photograph of a wintry landscape.
But stems have nodes and internodes, and roots have not, and this is the great
and apparent difference.</p>

<p>The covering of plant-stems is varied, and many instances of such
clothing will occur. We have woolly stems and hairy stems, which develop
into thorny ones—for thorns are only strong hairs. Spines and stings and
prickles defend the stems, and keep rude hands from meddling. We will
now cut the stem and see what it is composed of, and how it looks inside.
We have only to cut it across and again perpendicularly to find out a great
deal about the interior structure of the stems of branching plants (exogens).</p>

<p>The elder, from which the whistle of our boyish days is fashioned with
a penknife, will serve any lad for an illustration. Inside we find what is
called “pith,” which is <em>cellular tissue</em>. Round this is fibre, and outside is a
skin, or the plant-cuticle. We may remark that the tissues of flowering
plants are characteristic of the monocotyledonous and the dicotyledonous
plants. Of the former we append an illustration,—a section of palm-stem,—and
we find bundles of vascular tissue dispersed apparently at random
amongst the cellular tissue of the parenchyma, or cellular tissue. These
stems do not grow by the increase of the existing vascular tissue, but by
their new production at the circumference, and so they grow in both
directions, laterally and uprightly. These plants belong to the <span class="smcap">Endogens</span>,
and if Indian corn be grown we shall have full opportunity to study the
formation. In cutting a fern stem we are familiar with the “oak” pattern
of the matter it contains. We have few specimens of endogens in England.</p>

<p>The dicotyledonous stems are common to our trees and most plants,
and may therefore be considered with advantage. The stem consists of the
vascular tissue called “pith,” and we give an illustration of the cells magnified
very considerably. The arrow indicates the outward direction (fig. 757).</p>

<p>We here perceive the vascular bundle proper surrounded by a very
large-celled tissue, <i>aa′bef</i>. The almost square cells, <i>aa′</i>, form the epidermis
on which follows the less dense cellular tissue of the bark. The latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</a></span>
surrounds a half-moon-shaped bundle of bast-cells, <i>c</i>, which are separated
in the direction towards the interior, by a layer of cambium, <i>dd′d″</i>, from
the bundles of vascular tissue, consisting of
vessels and longitudinal cells. The latter tissues
may be distinguished in the transverse section
by the thicker walls, <i>gg</i>, and by their greater
breadth, <i>hh</i>. It is further to be remarked that
the cambium transparent tissue, <i>dd″</i>, appears on
both sides of the bundles of vascular tissue, and
extends to the next bundle, and thus presents
an uninterrupted circle throughout the entire
circumference of the stem.</p>

<p>On examining the section
of a one-year-old
dicotyledonous stem, magnified six times, as in
fig. 758, we perceive several parts clearly distinguishable
from each other, corresponding with the arrangement
of the bundles of vascular tissue.</p>

<p>Enclosed by the epidermis, <i>a</i>, is a large-celled
tissue, <i>b</i> <i>f</i> and <i>m</i>, in which a number of vascular
bundles form a circle. In each of these we notice
that the outer portion, consisting of bast-shell, <i>c</i>, is separated by the cambium,
<i>d</i>, from the inner woody portion, <i>e</i>. The cambium forms a closed circle which
penetrates through all the vascular bundles.</p>

<p>In the course of the further development of the stem, the parts, <i>a</i> <i>b</i> <i>c</i>,
constitute the <i>bark</i>, the vascular bundles, <i>e</i>, the <i>wood</i>, and the cellular tissue,
<i>f</i>, its pith. The tissues, <i>m</i>, penetrating between the vascular bundles, are
called the <i>medullary rays</i>. The cambium is to be regarded as the most
important part, since it is the source of new bundles of vascular tissue which
year by year increase the circumference of the stem.</p>

</div>

<p>The growth of a dicotyledonous stem is continued by the formation of
a new circle of vascular bundles on the circumference of the stem in the
second year. Each new bundle, as has already been shown, is produced
in the cambium, and consequently is deposited between the wood and inner
bark.</p>

<p>Thus every year a new layer is deposited between the previous formation
and the bark; and a section will exhibit these concentric rings of wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[Pg 670]</a></span>
obviously distinct from each other; and as one year is requisite for the
formation of a single layer of wood, these depositions are named <em>annual
layers</em> or <em>rings</em>. In fig. 759 we have a representation of a stem three years
old, and one of five years of age.</p>

<p>The number of rings in the stem do not invariably agree with the
number of years the tree has been growing, but it may be accepted as a
rule.</p>

<p>The stem is the medium of communication between the roots and
leaves at first; but after a year this important duty is deputed to the
cambium layers of new woody tissue, etc., and as time goes on the living
power has accumulated immediately under the bark. So although the tree
be quite hollow it will live. The interior has been closed up by deposition
of wood and has decayed; but the life functions being relegated to the bark,
the old tree lives on. If we remove the rind all round a tree it will die.</p>

<div class="caption"> Fig. 760.—Compound leaf.</div>
</div>

<p>When in the spring the young leaves appear upon the trees, and as
summer advances they become fully
developed, we are all grateful for the
beautifully varied tints of green, and for
the shade we can so fully enjoy. The
study of leaves is a most interesting and
instructive one, and nobody should omit
to examine them. Their forms are infinite,
or, at any rate, countless; their size
as varied as their forms. Many attributes
of the leaf will occur to every reader, and
we will briefly describe these essential
organs of plants. Air and light are necessary to the development of leaves,
and their principal use is to present a surface to the food material which the plant
absorbs. They breathe, as it were, and absorb the
carbonic acid from the atmosphere. These functions
are called “assimilation,” “transpiration,” and “respiration,”
which we will detail by-and-by.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_670b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 761.—Simple leaf.</div>
</div>

<p>Leaves are distinguished according to position
and duration. Some leaves have very simple forms,
others are compound, so to speak. Some are plain
and rounded, others are toothed, like the holly. The
skeleton of a leaf is a very interesting study, and it
will show the beautiful structure of these common
objects. The delicate lines of the green leaf are
“veins,” or sap-vessels, which convey the necessary
nourishment. The leaves are called the “embryonic” (seed-like), the
radicle, or root-leaf, the stalk-leaf, and the stipules, which grow at the base
of stem-leaves, and the floral leaves, which bear the flowers or fruit buds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[Pg 671]</a></span>
Leaves which are developed at the end of a chief axis are termed <em>blossoms</em>.
Of course it must be understood that all the
different kinds of leaves do not occur upon
the same plant. The leaf may be accepted
to mean the stem-leaf.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_671a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 762.—Net-veined leaf.</div>
</div>

<p>Leaves are folded up in various ways,
and the manner in which this is accomplished
is termed the <em>vernation</em> of the plant. The
leaves of endogens and exogens differ in their
veining. The former veins do not touch;
there is none of that beautiful interlacing
which we find in the exogenous leaves. In the former the veins
rise from base to apex, curving as they advance, as in the well-known
lily of the valley. This “nervous system” of the leaf is
its “venation,” and the veins distributed in the blade or <em>lamina</em> of the
leaf are twofold,—as remarked,—ascending
in curves, or diverging
from a central nerve called the
“mid-rib.” These lateral nerves
are either parallel or “reticulate”—that
is, net-like.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_671b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 763.—Linden tree.</div>
</div>

<p>We will now examine the
forms of leaves which are regulated
by the divergence and extension
of the divisions of the mid-rib.
Thus we get an orbicular, or
<em>peltate</em> leaf; <em>palmate</em>, <em>digitate</em>, and
<em>pedate</em> forms also occur, as may
be seen in the illustrations, pages
672 and 673, where all the varied
shapes can be studied. The leaf
consists of a <em>petiole</em> or stalk, and
the <em>lamina</em> or blade. The petiole is composed of bundles of vascular tissue;
the lamina is formed by their extension, the interstices
being filled with cellular tissue. So we perceive that the
leaves and stems are composed of similar materials. To
defend the tissue a skin, or epidermis, is placed upon the
surface of the leaf, and this <em>epidermis</em> is full of breathing
holes, or <em>pores</em>, called <em>stomates</em> (compare page 664).
There are also cells filled with chlorophyl, which gives
the leaf its green tint.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_671c.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 764.—Stomates, highly
magnified.</div>
</div>

<p>The <em>petiole</em> may be absent in a leaf, and when it is the
leaves are termed <em>sessile</em>, or sitting leaves. These leaves
sometimes coil round the stem, and are called “amplexicaul,”
or stalk embracers. These are simple leaves. Compound leaves are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</a></span>
composed of several blades or laminæ on a stalk, and are seldom sessile.
<span class="smcap">Simple Leaves</span> are almost innumerable
in form and variety. Leaves may be <em>equal</em>
or <em>unequal</em>, <em>acicular</em> or <em>linear</em>, <em>rounded</em> or
<em>oval</em>, <em>cordate</em> or <em>obcordate</em>, <em>reniform</em> or <em>sagittate</em>,
<em>perfoliate</em> or <em>connate</em>, <em>crisp</em>, <em>whorled</em> or
<em>truncate</em>, <em>retuse</em>, <em>acuminate</em> or <em>mucronate</em>.
The margins of simple leaves again are
entire, deft, notched, crenated, crenulated,
sinuous, or dentated. They are pinnatifid,
multifid, or lobed, according to the
divisions of the leaf.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<div class="caption"><a href="#Leaf_Shapes">LEAVES.</a></div>
<img src="images/i_672.jpg" alt="The link LEAVES leads to a list." />
</div>

<p>Compound leaves are also divided
into classes. The <em>pinnate</em>, as the rose-leaf,
the clover trefoil. There are “doubly
pinnate,” the digitate, as in the horse
chestnut. Compound and simple leaves
can be readily distinguished by inspection,
for the former are “articulated” to
the stalk and can be separated, but the
simple leaves will be torn, for they are
confluent throughout.</p>

<p>Leaves are evergreen or deciduous,
accordingly as they retain or shed themselves.
The ordinary leaf is deciduous;
the fir and the yew and the imported
laurel are evergreens. We have very few
of these as natives of England, the ivy,
yew, and fir being the three most common.
Sometimes a plant peculiar to
Killarney, and known as the arbutus,
is included in the list. But the Scotch
fir and the yew are distinctly native
evergreens.</p>

<p>The detailed characteristics of leaves
must be passed over until we come to
the fly-catching leaves—such as Venus’
fly-trap, the droseras, and nepenthes,
which appear to catch and devour insects
for food. The Venus’ fly-trap may be
examined, and we shall find the leaves
covered with tiny and very sensitive hairs.
Often a fly happens to alight upon the
leaf, which is extended in a most innocent
manner (<i>see</i> illustration). As soon as the fly settles the leaves close,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[Pg 673]</a></span>
and the digits lock tightly together, thus preventing the escape of the prey.
The droseras, sarracenias, and nepenthes also kill their food. The sarracenias
form curious cups, into which insects
are enticed in search of fluid, and then,
as in the case of the house-haunting
cockroach, they cannot get out again.
The nepenthes have a cup and lid for
insect-catching, and within the cup a
liquid is secreted.</p>

<p>We will close this portion of our
subject with a quotation from a recent
article upon botany referring to leaf arrangement.
The writer says:—</p>

</div>

<p>“Efforts have been made to determine the laws to which these various
modes of leaf-arrangement may be referable. The result is
found in the doctrine of ‘Phyllotaxy,’ as it is called, the
fundamental principle of the whole being that Nature, in
the disposition of the leaves upon the stem, works upon
precisely the same idea as that which is set forth so distinctly
and elegantly in the common pine-cone; and, on a
minor scale, in the beautiful cone of the
female hop; not to mention the quasi-cones
of many species of tropical palm,
such as the Sagus and the Mauritia; nor
to mention either, the very delicate repetition
of the whole series in the florets
of the Rudbeckia and the ripening fruits
of Chaucer’s daisy. In every one of the flower and
fruit arrangements mentioned,
the idea is the spiral,—the
same sweet old fashion which
we have had in the twining
stems of the convolvulus, the
woodbine, and the scarlet
bean; which comes out again in many a sea-shell,
and in human ringlets; and this idea, according
to ‘Phyllotaxy,’ governs the position of the leaves.
Following alternate leaves up the stem, their
sequence is clearly spiral. Through the non-development
of internodes, they are brought closer and
closer together; and even when the entire mass
of foliage is concentrated and condensed into the
rosulate form, as in the houseleek and the Echeverias,
the spiral prototype is still distinguishable.
The whole matter has been reduced to one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[Pg 674]</a></span>
arithmetical exactitude; and for those who love calculations and “fractions,”
the determination of the spirals, their continuity and intermixture, supplies
abundance of curious entertainment. All three modes of leaf-arrangement are
found in certain herbaceous plants, none disclosing this particular kind of
playfulness more plainly than the common pyramidal Loosestrife, <i>Lysimachia
vulgaris</i>, and the purple Lythrum of the waterside, in each of which very handsome
wild flowers, alternate, opposite, and whorled leaves may be found in near
neighbourhood. Alternate and opposite leaves are also met with, side by
side, in various species of Myrtaceæ; and imperfectly, upon young shoots
of the common ash-tree. The rule is, nevertheless, that there shall be
uniformity, and in many of the largest natural orders the rule is never
broken. In the Rosaceæ the stem leaves are invariably alternate; in the
Gentianaceæ they are invariably opposite.”</p>

<small>FLOWERING PLANTS.</small></h2>

<p class="hang">ORGANS OF INCREASE AND REPRODUCTION—THE FLOWER—THE
CALYX—THE COROLLA—THE STAMEN—THE PISTIL.</p>


<p>Some of the simplest plants are propagated by <em>spores</em>, which are
detached, and fall upon the ground to vegetate; but in the case of the
higher orders the reproduction of species is a much more elaborate process,
and is carried on by means of certain organs called flowers. Small buds, or
<em>ovules</em>, are formed, which develop into seed. Plants also produce buds,
which grow upon various parts of it, and are capable of reproducing their
species. We will first speak of <span class="smcap">Flowers</span>.</p>

<p>Flowers are not only the lovely blossoms we cut and place in our
rooms, but the reproductive organs of plants which may be very plain and
simple or gorgeous and fragrant, and in all probability the so-called flowers
are few in comparison to the unrecognized flowers. Trees and bushes
flower equally with the rose and the pink and carnation. Vegetables
flower as well as the lily, though we do not recognize it so well. Let us
now examine the “flower.”</p>

<p>Flowers may consist of four parts, but it is not absolutely necessary
that they should contain more than two. The four portions of a complete
flower are—</p>

<ol class="table"><li><span class="smcap">The Calyx.</span></li>
<li><span class="smcap">The Corolla.</span></li>
<li><span class="smcap">The Stamen.</span></li>
<li><span class="smcap">The Pistil.</span></li></ol>


<p>The two last mentioned are essential. The four organs are placed around
a pedicel or peduncle (flower stalk), and are known as floral whorls.</p>


<p>The <span class="smcap">Calyx</span> is the outermost whorl of all when all exist. The portions
of the calyx are known as <em>sepals</em>.</p>


<p>The <span class="smcap">Corolla</span> is usually the showy portion—the attraction of the
flower. The pieces of the corolla are called <em>petals</em>. The sweet fluids of
the plant are here concealed.</p>

<p>These parts—the calyx and corolla—are known as the floral envelopes,
or “perianth.” The tulip has one whorl only, and it is called the envelope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[Pg 676]</a></span></p>

<p>The calyx sometimes falls before the flower is full blown, as in the
poppy. Its lower portion is the “throat,” and the shape of the organ varies,
as will be seen by the illustrations.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_676a.jpg" alt="" />

</table></div></div></div>

<p>The sepals are usually three to five in number. The poppy has two,
and the well-known wall-flower four free—that is, disunited—sepals. The
primrose possesses five. The calyx is the outside rim of all, and we may
thus remember it, because its <em>sepals</em> alternate with the <em>petals</em> of the <em>corolla</em>.
The petals may be formed cup-fashion, as in the lily of the valley, and here
we have these sepals and petals in groups of three each.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 773.—Monopetalous
corolla.</div>
</div>

<p>The petals differ from ordinary leaves, and in them we find all the
beautiful tints and the odour we imbibe from
blossoms. The forms of corolla correspond
to those of the calyx, and are called by the
same names. But when corollas are absent
the petals of course cannot provide the
necessary colours for the flower. Then the
calyx is gifted, and the sepals are brilliant.
Thus Nature provides for everything.</p>

<p>Corollas are found with five or ten petals, and sometimes
with three, six, and nine—the numbers always doubling
or adding the original number. There may be four petals or eight, as in
the “tetramerous” corolla (fig. 771). Instances of others are illustrated,
and a plant whose petals, sepals, and stamens
are numerically equal, or are multiples of each
other, are termed “symmetrical.” The “regular”
flower does not vary much, as the petals are
of the same size and shape, but there are many
“irregular” flowers—as the pea—in which
portions of the calyx or corolla are of different
shapes. The “labiate” and the “campanulate”
are illustrated in figs. 774, 775, including the
convolvulus and the snap-dragon. These are
but a few examples of an almost endless diversity. The “regular” flowers—exemplified
in the buttercup and convolvulus—always present the same
figure to the observer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[Pg 677]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 775.—Campanulate.</div>
</div>

<p>To the petals the beautifully-varied colours of plants are due, and
though it is not possible to enter upon the subject here, we may conclude
that the various beauties of the
colours of flowers are owing to light
and air acting upon the various
“colouring matters” contained in
the plant. Seeds planted in a dark
cellar will spring up pale; admit
light, and they will become green,
for light thus acts upon the chlorophyl.
But the flowers of the plant
are not so dependent upon light,
as can easily be proved. Many
interesting experiments have been made upon flowers by acids and gases.<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Stamens</span> are the next in order for our consideration. They are
found within the petals (or the calyx if no petals be present). Stamens vary
very much in different plants both in number and general features—but, as
in the case of petals, they keep, as a rule, to certain numbers and doubles of
them. The stamen consists of two portions—a lower, thread-like part called
the filament, and an oblong bag or head, termed the <em>anther</em>. This contains
a powdery matter called pollen, and is the essential part of the stamen. The
filament, which corresponds to the petiole of the leaf, may be absent, in which
case the anther is called <em>sessile</em>. A lily will show the stamens perfectly, the
anther being prominent in many other plants also, such as daffodils and
fuchsias.</p>

<p>The stamens are very important organs with regard to the classification
of plants—for number, length, and position, whether free or united, are all
characteristic features. The length of filaments is always the same in the
same kind of plant, and therefore is a very palpable test.</p>

<p>The <em>anther</em> contains the <em>pollen</em>, a powdery matter, usually yellow-coloured,
but sometimes also red, brown, violet, or green-coloured. Pollen-grains
vary from 1/20 to 1/300 of a line in diameter. Under a powerful microscope
they appear as ellipsoidal, or sometimes spherical, triangular, polyhedral
vesicles, filled with a granular semi-fluid matter. To effect fecundation,
the pollen-grains must come into contact with a certain part of the plant
which is intended to receive them, and which is called the <em>ovule</em>, and is found
in the fourth or innermost verticil of the flower, the <em>pistil</em>. Of the further
development of the ovule, we shall have occasion to speak in the paragraph
treating of the <em>seed</em>.</p>

<p>At the proper time the anther opens and discharges its contents, the
pollen-grains, some of which reach the place of their destination. The
position of the stamens to the pistil is usually such that the latter can readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[Pg 678]</a></span>
receive the pollen-grains. In many plants, however, the stamens are too
short to reach the pistils; or the two essential organs of reproduction are in
separate flowers, or even on different plants. In such cases, the conveyance
of the pollen from the anthers to the pistils is effected by the agency of the
wind, or by that of insects, and more particularly by the bee. If the anthers
are removed from the flower previously to their opening, no fruit is produced.</p>

<p>Varieties of flowers and fruits are produced artificially, by shaking the
pollen of one plant upon the flowers of another, deprived of the stamens.
Many esteemed sorts of stock-gilliflowers and pinks have been produced in
this way.</p>

<p>The pistil constitutes the fourth and innermost whorl, and occupies
accordingly the centre of the flower and the apex of the axis, whose growth
is terminated with the production of the fruit.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_678a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 776.—Pistil.</div>
</div>

<p>The pistil also is formed by one or several modified leaves, called
<em>carpels</em>, in this part of the flower, and which exhibit
a more marked resemblance in colour and structure
to the ordinary leaves than the stamens and
petals do. The formation of the pistil from the leaf
may be considered to proceed in this manner: that
the edges of the leaf are folded inwards and unite,
whilst the mid-rib is prolonged upwards (fig. 776<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>).
The place where the margins of the folded leaves
are united is called <em>suture</em> or <em>seam</em> (<em>ventral suture</em>,
in contradistinction to the mid-rib, which is called
the <em>dorsal suture</em>); and it is here that the seed-buds or <em>ovules</em> are developed.</p>

<p>The pistil consists of two parts—viz., the <em>ovary</em> or <em>germen</em>, which contains
the ovules or young seeds, <em>a</em>, and the <em>stigma</em>, <em>b</em>, either placed upon the
ovary, or upon the <em>style</em>, or stalk, which is between the stigma and the ovary.</p>

<p>A <em>pistil</em> may be of one <em>carpel</em> (simple), or of more than one (compound).
The carpels or the carpellary leaves are the “ovaries.”</p>

<p>The pistil is a very important test for the classification of plants; some
trees have no pistils, and the ovules are consequently naked. Such plants
are called <em>gymnospermæ</em>. The coniferæ (firs and pines) are thus recognizable,
and the position of the ovule is very much that of the ordinary bud.</p>

<small>FLOWERING PLANTS (<i>continued</i>).</small></h2>

<p class="hang">THE FLORAL AXIS—INFLORESCENCE—FRUIT—SEED—NUTRITION OF
PLANTS—ABSORPTION OF CONSTITUENTS.</p>


<p>There are certain arrangements and mutual relations of the various portions
of the flowers which we have mentioned that it is useful to consider.
The <em>floral axis</em> refers to the position of the verticils, and <em>inflorescence</em> signifies
the arrangement of the flowers on the stem. Flowers which possess both
stamens and pistil are <em>hermaphrodite</em>; those with only stamens are male;
those with the pistil female flowers. If both organs be absent the flower is
neutral.</p>

<p>Plants bearing flowers in clusters form several distinct groups, to which
appropriate terms are applied indicative of their respective form of flora
arrangement.</p>

</div>

<p>In the examination of this kind of inflorescence (<em>indefinite</em> or <em>axillary
inflorescence</em>), the first object of remark is the general or primary peduncle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[Pg 680]</a></span>
termed <em>rachis</em>, and which bears numerous leaflets called <em>bracteoles</em> or <em>bractlets</em>,
from whose axils arise the <em>pedicellate</em> or <em>sessile</em> flowers. The lower bracts
often produce no flower-buds in their axils, and form instead a whorl surrounding
the heads of flowers on the primary axis, and which is called
<em>involucre</em> (as in the sun-flower, for instance).</p>

<p>1. (1) The <em>spike</em> (fig. 777). In this form of inflorescence, sessile or
short-stalked flowers are arranged along the rachis in the axils of the
bracts; the spike is said to be <em>compound</em> when small spikes or <em>spikelets</em>
arise again from the bracts of the secondary axis. (2) The <em>catkin</em> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[Pg 681]</a></span>
<em>amentum</em> (fig. 777 [2]); a spike, usually pendulous, which falls off, rachis and
all, by an articulation, as in the willow or hazel. 3. The <em>spadix</em>, a thick
fleshy spike (fig. 777 [3]); examples, <em>arum</em> and <em>calamus</em>. 4. The <em>cone</em>, a fruit-bearing
spike, covered with scales (fig. 777 [4]); examples, the <em>coniferæ</em>. 5. The
<em>raceme</em> or <em>cluster</em>, a spike with the flowers on longer pedicels (fig. 778); examples,
the <em>currant</em>. 6. The <em>panicle</em>, a branching raceme (fig. 779, <em>Yucca gloriosa</em>).
7. The <em>thyrsus</em>, a dense panicle, with longer peduncles in the middle than
at the extremities; example, <em>lilac</em>. 8. The <em>corymb</em>, a raceme, in which the lower
flower stalks are elongated and raised to nearly a level with the upper
(fig. 780)—example, <em>cerasus mahaleb</em>. 9. The <em>compound</em> or <em>branching corymb</em>,
a corymb in which the secondary axis again sub-divides; example, <em>Pyrus terminalis</em>.
10. The <em>umbel</em>: in this form the primary axis is greatly depressed, and
the peduncles arise from a common point, and spread out like radii of nearly
equal length, a whorl of bracts (<em>involucre</em>) surrounding the common base.
In the <em>compound umbel</em> (fig. 781), <em>Daucus carota</em>, the secondary axis
ends in small umbels surrounded by bracts, which is termed an involucel.
This is observable in the umbelliferous plants—carrot, parsley, hemlock, etc.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 783.—Inflorescence.</div>
</div>

<p>A very peculiar kind of inflorescence, which characterises the great family
of the <em>compositæ</em>, is illustrated by
fig. 783. We see here the enlarged
floral axis or receptacle, <i>a</i>, surrounded
by several whorls or bracts,
<i>b b</i>, which constitute a general
involucre; the membranous bracts,
(<i>paleæ</i>), <i>b´ b´</i>, seen in the receptacle,
bear in their axils the sessile
florets, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, which either have
a calyx, <i>e e</i>, or not. The florets
on the receptacle are either all of
them <em>tubular</em> (<em>d</em>) or <em>ligulate</em>
(tongue or strap-shaped); florets
(<em>c</em>) are associated with the tubular ones. The receptacle is not always flat,
but frequently presents a convex, globular, conical, concave, etc., shape.</p>

<p>In the absence of <em>paleæ</em> the receptacle is said to be naked. The florets
at the margin, or circumference, are termed <em>marginal flowers</em>, or <em>flowers of the
ray</em>; the florets in the disc (<em>centre</em>), <em>central flowers</em>, or <em>flowers of the disc</em>.</p>

<p>Some plants bear male and female flowers on the same stem. These
are termed <em>monæcious</em> plants. The oak is an instance. The diæcious plants
are those which bear stamens and pistil, or separately, on different plants, like
willows. We will now glance at the functions of the stamens and pistil.
The ovule has been mentioned as a tiny body in the ovary, and it consists of
a nucleus, and cellular tissue surround it, leaving a small hole called the
<em>micropyle</em>, into which the pollen tube enters after passing through the ovary.
As in the animal creation, the unions of different families succeed best; no
close relationship will fertilize so well as with other flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[Pg 682]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_682a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 784.—Male flower of nettle.</div>
</div>

<p>Fertilization is accomplished in two ways; (1) by the action of the
wind, by which the pollen is carried away to other
plants; and (2) by means of insects—the bee particularly.
These flowers have distinctive qualities
relatively. In the case of the pine the pollen is
powdery; so those plants which are thus fertilized
are the diæcious species, which include the poplar,
the oak, and the birch, as well as the pines. These
are all wind-carried pollen plants. The nettle is
illustrated here with male and female
flowers.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_682b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 785.—Female flower of nettle.</div>
</div>

<p>Plants fertilized by insects are visited
by them, and they carry away upon their
heads, or bodies, the pollen, which is then
thrust into the stigma by the insect; or
perhaps birds may carry the pollen in the
same way after sipping the nectar, and
thus playing an unconscious, but most important,
part in the economy of nature.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_682c.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 786.—Erect ovule.</div>
</div>

<p>We always find the <em>ovule</em> at the termination
of an axis; it is unable to form a seed alone. The pollen grains must
fertilize it, and in consequence many ovules come to
nought. The ovule is produced in the pistil, which, as
before stated consists essentially of two parts—the
<em>ovary</em> and the <em>stigma</em>; the latter secretes a fluid to
hold the pollen. We annex the representation of a
highly-magnified pistil (vertical section, fig. 786<em>a</em>).
The pollen grains are indicated by <em>d</em>, attached to
stigma, <em>c</em>, projecting through the style, <em>b</em>, into the
ovary, <em>a</em>, and passing through the ovules.</p>

<p>With the transmission of the pollen to the
ovary of the pistil, the functions of the anther and
stigma terminate; accordingly these parts of the
flower rapidly wither and decay after fertilization.
The filaments, the style, and the petals speedily
participate in the decay, but the sepals remain sometimes
persistent in an altered form. The ovary and
its contents alone proceed in their further development,
and undergo material changes, in which,
however, the bracts and the calyx often participate.</p>

<p>The fully developed and matured ovule, the
<em>seed</em>, is, of course, regarded as the <em>essential</em> part of
the fruit; the enlarged ovary forms the <em>pericarp</em>,
enclosing the seed. The form of the pericarp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[Pg 683]</a></span>
determines the external appearance of the denomination of the fruit. The
structure of the fruit, and the arrangement of its parts depends in a great
measure upon the number and position of the carpellary leaves in the pistil,
and the manner and extent
of their union, and the extent
to which their edges are
folded inwards.</p>

<p>The carpellary leaves
occupy the summit of the
floral axis. The axis terminates
either in one single
carpel, in which case the
ovary is one-celled, or <em>unilocular</em>;
or the axis is surrounded
by several carpels,
in which case the manner of their union
determines the number of cells in the
ovary.</p>

<p>The carpels are the chief agents
in the formation of the fruit, and they
form the endocarp (core), and sometimes
the whole pericarp, or seed-vessel.
Upon the nature of the various
parts and the changes they undergo during the ripening of the seeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[Pg 684]</a></span>
the nature of the fruit depends. The fruits are classified, some being the
produce of a single carpel, others of several united carpels.</p>

<p>Fruit, in botany, is by
no means limited to the juicy
products of trees or plants
which are so refreshing in the
summer weather, and so acceptable
in any form. In
plant life the herb yielding
seed produces a fruit equally
with the orange or the apple.
The fruit is the outcome of the
varied processes of the plant. We may
trace the plant from its tiny, sometimes
very minute seed, through
stem to flower and seed
again. “In the final struggle,
even when life is hopeless,
and starvation, in
consequence of drought,
is imminent—when all is
hopeless and barren, the
plant will make an effort
to produce its fruit and
flower.” This is a very
touching and interesting fact in nature—this last attempt to beautify the
earth and to propagate its species for the use of man.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_684c.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 797.—Poppy.</div>
</div>

<p>Fruit, then, is not limited to the
market and the stall.</p>

<p>This statement scarcely needs proof; but
if we consider for a moment
the number of “wild” fruits—the
parents, probably, of our
table-fruits—we find many
we cannot eat. In short,
out of the hundred thousand
plants which bear flowers
scarce one two-hundredth
part serve us as producers
of edible fruits.</p>

<p>The fruit is the result of the flower, and
if any objection be made by readers on the
part of the common fig, it will be found that
this appreciated fruit really consists of male and female flowers that are fertilized
by the action of minute insects, which enter and depart (sometimes they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[Pg 685]</a></span>
die, and are found dead and black in the figs). No blossom is perceived
on the tree, because within the green sac the so-called “seeds” (really the
fruits) are developing. A fig is a sac full of fruits.</p>

<p>The <em>legume</em> or pod is formed of a single carpel bearing
seeds. We annex illustrations of the pod. The
covering is called the <em>pericarp</em>, and the parts when
opened separate into valves. Dehiscent fruits shed
their seeds, indehiscent fruits do not; they lie
within the seed-vessel, like the acorns and nuts.
These are dry fruits, but there are others of a soft
nature, such as apples or gooseberries.</p>


<p>Fruits are variously named, and underneath
will be found a list. We have the aggregate, like
the mulberry, etc.; the dehiscent fruit of one carpel
like the pea, etc.; the simple fruits as cherry,
nettle, wheat, etc. The dandelion fruit is often a
precious object in children’s estimation, as it is
blown away to ascertain the time. There are
indehiscent fruits with many carpels,—the common
buttercup, for instance, and the strawberry. A list
is added.</p>

<p>The cryptogamia or acrogens is the botanical term for these plants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[Pg 687]</a></span>
of which we must be very brief in our description,—not that the subject is
not worthy of a much larger space than we can devote to it, but our pages
are not elastic.</p>

</div>

<p>There are numbers of plants without pistils or stamens properly so
called. They are hidden from human observation—buried out of sight; and
in the fern, moss, and other primitive plants they are thus hidden. There
are several families of the cryptogamia,
but two main sections include
them all—viz., the cormogens and
thallogens. These are sometimes
known as cormophytes and thallophytes,
but the former will be our
terms, and they include the ferns,
algæ, lichens, and mosses, with many
other families, which we do not
propose to examine in this summary
sketch. The microscope will here
be a great aid if not always absolutely
necessary for any close investigation.</p>

<p>We are all familiar with the
appearance of ferns, and we may
commence with a few observations
concerning them. They are an
extensive family and very beautiful, some of the tropical species being particularly
noticeable for elegance. We are here mostly concerned with the development
of the plant. The polypod ferns fructify under the leaves or “fronds,”
which open from a ball. The seed-cases or <em>sorri</em> are situated at the back
of the fronds in brown spots, and when examined they will be found to be
collections of capsules like tiny cases. There is a kind of band at the upper
part which at the proper time is extended, and tearing open
the capsule releases the seeds. These seeds or “spores” are
very minute, and not properly seeds but buds, every one of
which can generate seeds. So if we try to grasp
in imagination the generating powers of a few
fern fronds, we shall miserably fail in the
attempt.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 815.—Bryum.</div>
</div>

<p>Some ferns have the “spores” upon the
summit of the frond. The osmundas belong
to this family, and are known to all as the “flowering
fern,” a contradiction palpable enough under the circumstances.
The beautiful dust upon some ferns has been mistaken for
“spores” by many people, but it is merely a natural ornament of the plant.
The venation and vernation of ferns are very curious, but in the determination
of ferns the only sure way is to consider the <em>sorri</em> and the venation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[Pg 688]</a></span>
The differences that puzzle may be little or great, but when the sorri have
been examined all doubts will be set aside.</p>

<p>There are about three thousand varieties of ferns known, and we give
a few illustrations of them, although any detailed description is out of the
question, for we have to mention the beautiful mosses of which there are in
Britain more than five hundred different species, all extremely beautiful,
perfectly innocuous, and even beneficial.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Mosses and Algæ.</span></p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 817.—Club-moss.</div>
</div>

<p>These plants are extremely lowly in the score of creation, and also in
stature. Very few mosses attain any elevation,
only the “sporangia”
shoot up, and the plants are
very delicately formed, the
leaves being all of the same
pattern. They are common in
damp situations, and thrive in
woods, streams, and banks.
The <em>Fontinalis</em> is a river moss,
while the <em>Hypnum</em> is found in
hedges. The Lycopodiaceæ
or the club-moss family is intermediate
between ferns and mosses.
They are found in warm, moist climates, and contain a sort of brimstone.
They grow well with ferns under glass.</p>

<p>The <em>Musci</em> or moss-family proper are useful in various ways. We have
also the <em>liverworts</em>, which bear some resemblance to lichens. They grow
between stones near water, or in damp situations. There are two distinct
families, both beautiful when examined, and
are named Marchantiaceæ, and Jungeramanniaceæ, or scale moss.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 819.—Various diatomaceæ.</div>
</div>

<p>The <em>Thallogens</em> or Thallogenæ
include algæ, lichens,
and fungi, which are the lowest
of the plants, and all very
much alike. The algæ are
termed “protophytes,” and
consist of living cells propagating
by subdivision, or union. The thallogens
have therefore no distinct axes, leaves,
or stomata.</p>

<p>The algæ are thus simply cellular plants found in salt or fresh water,
hot and cold. They sometimes appear as “slime.” Some contain silicia,
and are termed <em>Diatomaceæ</em>, and these propagate by subdivision, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[Pg 689]</a></span>
they die their shelly covering remains, and we find the shells or cases in all
earthy formations. These diatomaceæ have been raised from the beds of
oceans, and Atlantic soundings have revealed their presence,—as mud, when
examined, proves to be these remains of vegetable shells. Thus the infinitely
little in the animal and vegetable worlds meet at the bottom of the
sea, as well as on dry land.</p>

<p>There are marine and fresh-water algæ—the former familiar to us as
seaweeds which possess air-bladders that children love to explode, and
which assist the algæ to float. They attach themselves to rocks, generally
at the base; the lovely colours of seaweeds are well known. They will be
recognized under the name of “tangle” (fucus), which, when burned, gives
kelp and barilla, which is full of iodide and sodium. The Sargasso Sea is
composed of miles of algæ which live in the open ocean. The <em>Carrageen</em> or
Irish moss is very nutritious and useful in consumptive cases. Indeed, all
algæ, if not absolutely useful, are certainly not deleterious. The “bladder-wrack”
was formerly useful for the production of soda.</p>

<p>“The life-history of one of these uni-cellular plants in its most
simple form, can scarcely be better
exemplified than in the <i>Palmogeœa
macrococca</i>, one of those humble forms of
vegetation which spreads itself as a green
slime over damp stones, walls, etc. When
this slime is examined with a microscope,
it is found to consist of a multitude
of green cells, each surrounded by
a gelatinous envelope; the cell which
does not seem to have any distinct membranous
wall is filled with granular
particles of a green colour, and a ‘nucleus’ may sometimes be distinguished
through the midst of these. When treated with tincture of
iodine, however, the green contents of the cell are turned to
a brownish hue, and a dark-brown nucleus is distinctly
shown. Other cells are seen, which are considerably elongated,
some of them beginning to present a sort of hour-glass
contraction across the middle; in these is commencing
that curious <em>multiplication by duplicative subdivision</em> which
is the mode in which increase nearly always takes place
throughout the vegetable kingdom.”<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lichens</span> are numerous, and may be found upon the bark of trees in
dry forms of grey and yellow growth, and on walls and old stones in our graveyards.
On the hills we find them growing upon the granite, and it would
appear that they prefer stone to any other holding ground. The Arctic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[Pg 690]</a></span>
lichens form the principal food of the useful reindeer, and “Iceland moss”
is represented as wholesome for man. Lichen is derived from the Greek
term for “wart.”</p>


<p>The <span class="smcap">Fungi</span> are very important, and with them we will close our summary.
They include the favourite mushrooms and poisonous toad-stools, with
many other “fungous growths,” from the “mould” on the jam pot to the
mushroom.</p>

</div>

<p>Some of these fungi are peculiar to the substances upon which they
exist, and are in numerous instances destructive. The microscopic fungus
<i>Puccinea graminis</i> is the
parasite which fixes itself to
corn, and produces the disease
known as mildew, and
the <i>Uredo segetum</i> (another
microscopic fungus) causes
the “smut”; the “bunt” is
caused by the <i>Uredo fœtida</i>,
and the “spur” or “ergot,”
which attacks rye, is caused
by the <i>Acinula clavis</i>. These
fungi completely destroy the
grain of corn in which they
form, and propagate in the
most rapid manner; the
ergot is moreover a dangerous poison to those who eat the bread made of
rye infected by it. The truffle is a kind of underground fungus, and is
esteemed a dainty. Mushrooms are also fungi, and several species are
sufficiently wholesome; these are the field mushroom and the fairy-ring
mushroom.</p>

<p>Any organic substance will shortly become covered with this “mould”
or mildew. The air is so full of the germs of animal and vegetable life that,
as it penetrates everywhere, the smallest supply must contain some germs;
and these, under a powerful microscope, present most beautiful forms and
colours. We annex (fig. 822) some of these forms highly magnified. They
are deposited by the air, and the substance into which they happen to fall
determines the kind of life which is to inhabit it. A few of these spores only
come to maturity.</p>

<p>We again take the liberty to quote Dr. Carpenter on this subject.
He says:—</p>

<p>“There are scarcely any microscopic objects more beautiful than some
of those forms of mould or mildew which are so commonly found growing
upon the surface of jams and preserves, especially when they are viewed with
a low magnifying power and by reflected light; for they present themselves
as a forest of stems and branches of extremely varied and elegant forms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[Pg 691]</a></span>
loaded with fruit of singular delicacy of conformation, all glistening brightly
on a dark ground.</p>

<p>“The universality of the appearance of these simple forms of fungi
upon all spots favourable to their development, has given rise to the belief
that they are spontaneously produced by decaying substances, but there is
no occasion for this mode of accounting for it, since the extraordinary means
adopted by nature for the production and diffusion of the germs of these
plants adequately suffices to explain the facts of the case.</p>

<p>“The number of sporules which any one fungus may develop is almost
incalculable; a single individual of the “puff-ball” tribe has been computed
to send forth no fewer than ten millions. And their minuteness is such that
they are scattered through the air in the finest possible dust, so that it is
difficult to conceive of a place from which they should be excluded.”</p>

<p>Pure water exposed to the air does not afford nourishment to the
germs which fall into it, till a sufficient number of them shall have been
deposited to form a food for
those which come after them;
but if we mix with the water
any soluble vegetable or
animal matter, in a short
time the microscope will detect
the growth of the germs
that are being deposited, for
where nourishment is, there
only can they be developed.
These germs are capable of
existing for an indefinite
period, either floating in the
water, or blown about by the
air, and have been detected
hundreds of miles from land; the rigging and sails of ships far away from
shore are often covered with what sailors suppose to be sand blown from
the land, but which are organic substances, either
vegetable or animal. According to Humboldt, the
Red Sea has derived its name from the fact that at
certain seasons the surface of the water has a reddish
appearance, and this (as he says) he was fortunate
enough to observe, which colour he found to be due to
myriads of red fungi, which had formed on the surface. The seeds of some
plants are furnished with minute wings or plumes, which cause them to be
borne on the air or floated on the water (fig. 824), to fertilise some barren
spot, perhaps a coral reef, which has at length reached the surface of the
water, and which ascends no higher, for the little creatures which built it are
aquatic, and cannot live exposed to the air; this coral reef now becomes a
receptacle for seaweed and fungi, which float on the surface of the ocean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[Pg 692]</a></span>
are washed on to the reef, die, decay, and leave behind a thin layer of
mould, which process being repeated again and again, forms an elevated
edge to the reef, enclosing a lake, or “lagoon” as it is called, the waters of
which evaporate, and the space is filled up in the same way as the edge was
formed, together with the excrements of birds, etc., forming layer after layer
of mould, and the surface becomes fit for the growth of larger seeds, as the
cocoa-nut, banana, etc., which are drifted on to it by the waves; in this way
a coral reef becomes an island fit to be inhabited by man and other animals.</p>

<p>It is impossible for any person not accustomed to observe the manner
of the propagation of the fungi, to understand a written description, for the
fructification of these plants are very varied in the manner of the development
of the spores. They are not generally hurtful, but much caution
should be observed in the matter of the mushroom, which may be distinguished
by the pale pink and black of the under part. There are many
poisonous fungi, but the greater number are harmless, though they are not
intended for food. They simply clear away the decaying growths, and act
as safety-valves to Nature by carrying away what is not required, to give it
to the air again to be renewed into life.</p>

<p>The vegetable kingdom forms the link between the minerals and the
animals. The vegetable derives food and nourishment from water, carbonic
acid, and ammonia, which are, as we already know, made up of certain
elements, and thus supply us all with food. They give out oxygen for the
use of animals, and are thus, in another sense, the source of life. The
growth of a plant is very interesting, and we may conclude by following it.</p>

<p>The seed is sown, and the cells of the “cellular tissue” become
developed, passing some upwards, some downwards, to form a radicle or
plumule, as explained. The latter carries up the cotyledon, which begins to
decompose carbonic acid from the atmosphere, and fixing the carbon as
woody fibre. The leaves are then formed and more fibres, and so on for every
leaf; thus the number of woody fibres which form the trunk of a tree
is in proportion to the number of leaves which that tree has borne, from
which we come to the conclusion that the size of the trunk of a tree is the
sum of all its branches. While all this is going on, the cellular tissue of the
downward part or radicle also becomes developed and divides out into roots,
on the surface and at the extremities of which are minute cellular bodies
called “spongioles” (from their power of absorbing moisture), which take up
the fluid of the earth which surrounds them; this moisture ascends through
the vessels of the plant till it arrives at the surface of the leaves, where it is
exposed to the action of light and sunshine. The ascent of the moisture of
the earth was first correctly explained by Du Trochet, and is owing to a
peculiar power which he discovered, and which is called “Endosmose”; this
consists in the tendency which a fluid has to penetrate a membrane on the
other side of which is a fluid of greater density than itself. This may be
seen by the following experiment: obtain a piece of glass tubing about a
foot long, having the end blown out into the form of a bell, as in fig. 825, tie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[Pg 693]</a></span>
a piece of bladder over the expanded end and fill it partly with syrup or
gum-water, so that this shall rise in the stalk about an inch; place this in a
glass of water with the bladder downwards, and the fluid will be seen slowly
to rise in the stalk, so that in perhaps an hour it will rise to the top. This
apparatus resembles one of the spongioles at the extremity of the fibre of
a root.</p>

</div>

<p>The rain falling through the air carries with it a certain amount of
carbonic acid and ammonia, which the air always contains, and it is the
whole source of the nitrogen which forms a very important part of the
bodies of plants and animals. When the rain arrives at the surface of the
earth, it sinks down into it and carries with it all soluble vegetable or
animal matter which it meets with, together with any soluble earthy matter
which may exist in the soil; this forms the sap of the tree. When it
arrives at the surface of the leaf, the watery part of
it combines with the carbonic acid of the air (through
the influence of light), and appropriating its carbon,
gives out the oxygen; this is the true respiration of
plants, and is exactly the reverse of what takes place
during the respiration of animals, in which case oxygen
is absorbed and carbonic acid given off. The carbon
thus retained by the plant combines with the elements
of the water to form the solid green substance called
chlorophyl, which is the basis of all the tissues of the
plant; the ammonia is also decomposed, and its nitrogen
combining with the oxygen and hydrogen of the
water, and the carbon of the carbonic acid forms those
compounds which constitute the most nourishing parts
of vegetables, such as albumen, gluten, etc., and of
which all the animal tissues are built up, for the production
of these organic substances takes place in the
vegetable only, animals simply appropriating them
for their food. The sap which reaches the leaf is not all converted into
chlorophyl, but also into those peculiar juices which are found in plants,
some of which contain sugar, some gum, others (as the pine tribe) turpentine,
and in the laurel tribe camphor, all of which are substances containing
much carbon; moreover the solid wood and bark are deposited from these
juices as they descend from the leaf after having been acted on by light (or
the actinic power associated with it). Now, as the water, ammonia, and
carbonic acid which descend with the rain are from the air, and as the
vegetable is formed wholly by their absorption, it may be fairly said that
the vegetable kingdom (and therefore the animal) feeds upon the air, and
that the trees do not grow out of the earth, but into it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Classification of Plants.</span></p>

<p>For the groundwork of the system of classification which universally
obtains at present, we are indebted to Linnæus, a Swede, born in 1707. In
his classification of plants, Linnæus followed two different methods. In the
one, he based his division of plants in classes and orders, upon certain peculiarities
in the floral organs. This system, being thus founded on characters
taken from certain parts of the plant only, without reference to others, and
having something artificial in it, has for that reason been termed the <em>artificial</em>
system, but it is now more generally known as the <em>Linnæan</em> system. In the
other method, he arranged the plants according to certain general resemblances
and affinities, in natural orders or families. This system, which is
known as the <em>natural</em> system, has subsequently been much improved.</p>

<p>We use the term <em>species</em>, to designate a number of individual plants,
which, in all essential and unvarying characters, resemble each other more
closely than they do any other plant; the term <em>genus</em> or <em>kind</em>, to designate an
assemblage of nearly allied species, agreeing with one another in general
structure and appearance more closely than they do with any other species.
Here, too, it must be obvious, that while all parts of the plant may furnish
<em>specific</em> characters, the character of the <em>genera</em> are taken exclusively from the
parts of fructification.</p>

<p>In the name of a plant both the genus and the species are given. The
name designating the genus is called the <em>generic</em> name of the plant, the one
designating the species, the <em>specific</em> or <em>trivial</em> name. Thus, for instance, we
have the genus <em>Viola</em>, which includes the species <em>Viola odorata</em>, sweet violet;
<em>Viola canina</em>, dog violet; <em>Viola tricolor</em>, heart’s-ease.</p>

<p>It is necessary to give the Latin names of plants, as the common name
differs, not only in different countries, but even in different parts of the same
country.</p>

<p>An assemblage or group of allied genera, agreeing in their general characters,
though differing in their special conformation, is called an <em>order</em> or
<em>family</em> of plants.</p>

<p>The sunflower, the daisy, the aster, and the dahlia, are, for example,
plants of different genera, but which, all of them, belong to the same order
or family.</p>

<p>All plants are divided into three primary classes—viz., <em>Dicotyledons</em>,
<em>Monocotyledons</em>, and <em>Acotyledons</em>, as has been stated already.</p>

<p>A proper degree of familiarity with the systematic classification of plants
is of the very highest importance to the student. A successful pursuit of
this branch of the botanical science presupposes a thorough knowledge of
the structure and physiology of plants, and requires, moreover, the aid of
attentive observation, and also some diligence in collecting and arranging
plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[Pg 695]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Artificial or Linnæan System of Classification.</span></p>

<p>In this system plants are divided into twenty-four classes; twenty-three
of these contain the <em>Dicotyledons</em> and <em>Monocotyledons</em> indiscriminately; the
twenty-fourth class contains the <em>Acotyledons</em>.</p>

<p>The first twenty-three classes are founded on the number, position, relative
lengths, and connection of the stamens. The twenty-fourth comprises
the plants with inconspicuous flowers. Every class is subdivided again into
several orders. This division depends, in the first thirteen classes, on the
number of the styles; in classes XIV. and XV. on the nature of the fruit;
in classes XVI. to XVIII. and XX. to XXII. on the number of stamens; in
classes XIX. and XXIII. on the perfection of the flower. In class XXIV.
the orders are formed according to natural affinities.</p>

<p>With all its imperfections, the artificial system has this advantage, that
the character on which it is founded is sufficiently conspicuous (that is, of
course, with the plants in full flower) to render it generally easy to ascertain
the class and order of a plant. At all events, it may serve as a useful
artificial key, and as such may be combined advantageously with the natural
system.</p>

of botanic classification must partake more or less of an artificial character,
as many orders of plants merge so insensibly into others that their respective
limits cannot be accurately or rigorously defined.</p>

<p class="hang">CLASSIFICATION OF ANIMALS—VERTEBRATES AND INVERTEBRATES—PROTOZOA—HYDROZOA—ACTINOZOA.</p>


<p>Zoology treats of life—of organized beings which are capable of voluntary
motion. Plants exist, animals live and move. Both are organic
beings, but the latter possess the faculty of <em>will and spontaneous movement</em>.
The animal can leave a place and enjoy other surroundings, the plant
cannot. We have already crossed the borderland which connects the
plant and the animal. We have seen plants almost animals. We could
commence this section with animals which are almost plants, so closely
do the divisions approach each other.
<span class="smcap">Zoology</span> is the science of the knowledge
of animals as <span class="smcap">Botany</span> is of the knowledge
of plants.</p>

</div>

<p>Where there is vegetation there are
animals, not quadrupeds or bipeds necessarily,
but numbers of small, it may be invisible,
creatures which exist upon the
vegetable kingdom—the algæ and minute
creations of globules and cells, the infusoria
already mentioned, the corals, etc. And
in the “protozoa,” or first specimens of
animal life, we have a similarity to the
vegetable kingdom; we then get by gradual
steps to other more perfect beings, <em>each
after his kind</em>, till we arrive at the most
perfect animal—<span class="smcap">Man</span>.</p>

<p>Animals are divided into two families, the <span class="smcap">Invertebrate</span> and the
<span class="smcap">Vertebrate</span>. The former has no spine nor skeleton; the latter has both.
These again are divided into sub-families, classes, and orders, as follows.</p>

<p>Man is an animal—but what is an animal? We can scarcely tell in
a few words. Linnæus defined the <em>difference</em> between the animal and the
plant, for the former, said he, live, grow, and feel, while the latter live and
grow. We have protozoa in the animal kingdom consisting of a single cell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[Pg 701]</a></span>
or blood corpuscle, some others without mouths or digestive organs, some
have no head; some, as in the tape-worm, only a so-called head, with
suckers or attachments, after which it develops joints, which are at first
imperfect, but gradually mature as they are pushed farther away by new-issuing
joints.</p>

<p>Animals, therefore, do not all possess organs, nor is there any common
organ by which all animals can be classed. The indispensable in one is
absent in another, and while our
mouths and digestive apparatus
are all important, in other animals
suckers and no digestive apparatus
at all is quite sufficient. Some
have one mouth, some several;
some have mouths and a proboscis
to assist them, some only the trunk
and no mouth—so called—at all,
as in some insects.</p>

<p>The organisms which could
not be distinguished from vegetables
were termed zoophytes, or
plant animals, and, were space available, a comparison might be instituted
between the extremes of growth of the animals and plants, from the largest
whales to the tiny microscopic protozoa, and from the mould upon jam to
the gigantic trees of California, one leaf of which it is said will shelter
twenty men from rain.</p>

<p>Cuvier spent many years in perfecting his systematic arrangements of
animals, and this classification, though many rearrangements have been
made as modern discovery progressed, may be regarded as the fundamental
system of all. Professor Agassiz adopted it with modifications. Professor
Nicholson has made a somewhat different arrangement, but essentially there
will be found but slight difference between them. We append both these
arrangements for comparison:—</p>

<p>In the vertebrated animals the blood is red in consequence of the
minute cells (<em>corpuscles</em>) which contain the colouring matter. In invertebrate
animals these red cells are absent, and so the animals are white-blooded.
Some animals, again, are cold-blooded like the fish; birds and mammalia
have warm blood. It is worthy of remark that the higher we advance in
the scale the fewer the offspring of the animal. The animalcules multiply at
the rate of many billions a day, and even one codfish is stated to contain
more than nine millions of eggs. A mackerel will produce 500,000; and so
on, as we rise, we find mammals with seldom more than ten young at a time,
down to one single offspring.</p>

<p>We could fill pages with the account of the differences existing between
animals created for such different purposes and fitted to inhabit different
climates, their mode of feeding and catching prey. The manner of bringing
forth and rearing the young, and the temperament and temper of the
animal creation would fill a volume, but we cannot now stay to examine
these various characteristics. The following is the arrangement now
usually adopted:—</p>

<p>We will adopt the latter order as being the more modern, and endeavour
to make the various classes of the invertebrates clear to the mind, if we
cannot present them to the vision, of the reader.</p>

<p>In our sketch of Botany we remarked upon the similarity existing
between the cells of plants and animals, and although there are, of course,
differences, there are many points of resemblance in these cells.</p>

<p>Plants have their lowest representatives called Protophytes. Animals
which correspond to this class are termed Protozoa, from the Greek, <i lang="el">proton</i>,
first, and <i lang="el">zoön</i>, animal. The former are, as already mentioned, seen
amongst the algæ, consisting of simple cells, and protozoa cannot easily be
distinguished from them except in the matter of nutriment, for some protozoa
have no mouth except in the <em>infusoria</em> class. The cells are very
much alike, and Dr. Carpenter sums them up briefly as follows:—</p>

<p>“The animal cell, in its most complete form, is comparable in most parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[Pg 704]</a></span>
of its structure to that of the plant, but differs from it in the entire absence of
the ‘cellulose wall’ or of anything that represents it, the cell-contents being
enclosed in only a single limitary membrane, the chemical composition of
which, being albuminous, indicates its correspondence with the primordial
utricle. In its young state it seems always to contain a semi-fluid plasma,
which is essentially the same as the protoplasm of the plant, save that it
does not include chlorophyl granules, and this may either continue to
occupy its cavity (which is the case in cells whose entire energy is directed
to growth and multiplication), or may give place, either wholly or in part,
to the special product which it may be the function of the cell to prepare.
Like the vegetable cell, that of animals very commonly multiplies by
duplicative subdivision, it also (especially among protozoa) may give origin
to new cells by the breaking up of its contents into several particles.”</p>

<p>The protozoa are microscopic creatures consisting of one or more
cells, and are infinitely little, thousands existing in a drop of water. They
have no distinction of sexes, and their generation takes place by subdivision
or blending of cells. The infusoria are the highest of the protozoa, and
were formerly included amongst the radiata. Their numbers are infinite,
and in a drop of water (<i>see</i> fig. 828) some very interesting specimens will be
found. These infusoria are merely <em>sarcode</em>, or a jelly-like substance, and
some have cilia, or hairy appendages, with which they agitate the water and
cause a kind of current which brings them food. It is this partaking of
food which has served to divide the lowest animal from the lowest vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[Pg 705]</a></span>
creations. There is no progressive increase of development from the lowest
plant to the highest animal. The animal begins by himself, as it were, as
the plant, and both grow up in different directions. The protozoa exist
upon organic substances, while plants absorb inorganic substances and
assimilate them.</p>

<p>The <em>Gregarinidæ</em> are very tiny cells, and though microscopically minute,
they sometimes develop into worm-like or elongated oval bodies. They
inhabit the intestines of crustacea, worms, and cockroaches, as well as of
higher animals. They are capable of certain motion, but are not furnished
even with the “false feet” (<em>pseudo podia</em>) of the rhizopoda, the next animal
in these very low scales of creation.</p>

<p>Of the Rhizopoda the <span class="smcap">Amebæ</span> are very interesting, and we find them
in our veins as well as in the stagnant green water of the pond. They are
simply <em>sarcode</em> or jelly, and, as the name implies, the amebæ can change
their appearance (<em>amoibos</em>, changing). They possess a kind of crawling,
progressive motion, and under the microscope will be perceived to develop
a tiny bud, as it were, which is the “false foot” that assists its progress.
These amebæ are in our blood moving about, and are always altering their
form, and when warm they move more quickly in the red blood corpuscles
or cells, but excessive heat will kill them.</p>

<p>These curious creatures feed by the foot they protrude; and by drawing
in the “process” as it is termed, they can collect within themselves the
nourishment they require. Of course they have no mouth, and if we can
conceive a creature of this kind which thrusts out from a jelly-bag a tiny
lump, and pulls it in again at any time and place it likes, we have an idea
of an ameba.</p>

<p>The pond ameba is somewhat different from the others, inasmuch
as it possesses an outer and inner portion or layer which are different
in density. There is what is termed a contractile vesicle which “beats”
as a heart beats, but this is very primitive. There is really no structure
whatever in these rhizopoda, and, as we have seen, their shape is always
undergoing change. The outer and inner layers of the amebæ are called
“the ectosarc” and “endosarc” respectively; the latter contains the darker
portion—the nucleus.</p>

<p>The <em>Foraminifera</em> have already been mentioned in the chapters on
Geology. We find these minute creatures must have had a great deal to
do with the building up of rocks, as they have the power to make tiny
coverings for themselves, which have been built into rocks by the addition
of sandy particles, and consolidated by pressure. Here we have a most
wonderful instance of the tiniest creatures producing the greatest masses
of the earth. The body is merely <em>sarcode</em>, the shell is carbonate of lime.
The foraminifera produce false feet in abundance, which surround the cell
like fine hairs or rays. They live in the sea, and when they die the shells
descend upon the ocean floor, where they undergo many changes and
become converted into rock. The ooze of the great oceans is composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[Pg 706]</a></span>
of these shells, and is practically a chalky deposit; the shells are being
built up as in former ages with the curious nummulites of the Eocene formation,
which are amongst the most interesting of fossils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sponges.</span> We must go on at once to the <em>Sponges</em>, which form such
an interesting subject as they are so familiar to us all. Sponge is not often
regarded by the public as an animal, and though perhaps authorities may
not have yet concluded in what category they should be placed, we may
consider them here according to the list.</p>

<p>We find the spongida both in fresh and salt water, and they have given
rise to much discussion as to whether they should be classed as animals
at all. But that question having been finally settled, we can proceed to
examine a sponge in its native state, and we shall find both skeleton and “flesh.”</p>

<p>The skeleton is hard and composed of needles of “tiny” texture.
The flesh is “sarcode,” and the animal possesses no mouth, but is full of
holes (pores) and canals through which the water is continually distributed.
The outer layer of the sponge is formed of ultimate components of the living
substance of the sponge (like the amebæ we have been considering). Each
contains a nucleus, and when joined together form
the outer layer of the body. Beneath is a wide
cavity communicating with the exterior by means of
minute holes, and filled with water. The cavity
separates the superficial layer from the deeper substance,
which is of the same character. In the
water passages of the sponge are cilia which induce
a cement, and the interior canals develop into chambers
lined with sponge particles, and the water
carries particles to the sponge, which represents a kind of sub-aqueous
city, where the people are arranged about the streets and roads in such
a manner that each can easily appropriate his food from the water as it
passes along.<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_706.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 829.—Fragment of sponge (magnified).</div>
</div>

<p>Sponge, then, is a mass of living organisms—tiny living creatures
capable of feeding and of movement, resembling amebæ or perhaps infusoria,
with cilia, to enable them to obtain nourishment by a kind of inhalation
or respiration. They are reproductive by sexual and a-sexual processes
which produce <em>spongellæ</em>. The living sponge is a beautifully coloured
animal, and grows upon almost any solid foundation; and in the autumn
the parent sponge displays a number of yellow dots or “gemmules,” which
are the young. These are soon cast off and left to shift for themselves,
and seek their fortunes, helpless as they appear, in the wide and stormy
sea. At last they find a resting-place, and fix themselves for ever, growing
up and reproducing their species until they are carried off to be sold and
used in civilized countries for domestic purposes.</p>

<p>We must leave these curious animalculæ and glance at the <span class="smcap">Infusoria</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[Pg 707]</a></span>
which constitute a higher branch, but microscopic and universal, and include
those called Flagellate, Ciliate, and Tentaculate. The first have whip-like
cilia, or feelers, or filaments, which are ever in motion to cause a movement
of the water and carry food to the animal. You will find plenty of infusoria
in any stagnant water, and when placed under the microscope a mouth may
be perceived, but no stomach, nor any apparent receptacle for food, which
appears to enter at once into the body substance. The other kinds
capture their food by seizure by the
tentacles, or by agitating the cilia,
like the flagellata, and thus whipping
the nourishment towards the mouth,
as children will draw in a toy boat
to land by agitating the water in the
given direction. These cilia, or hairs,
serve for organs of locomotion as well
as of capture. These creatures are
called Infusoria, because they exist
in vegetable “infusions” exposed to
the atmosphere.</p>

<div class="figright">

<div class="caption">Fig. 830.—Structure of polypidoms.</div>

<p>Decaying vegetable or animal
substances, such as the leaves of
trees, grass, a piece of flesh, etc.,
affused with water and exposed to
air and warmth, will speedily, upon
microscopic examination, be found
peopled with numbers of most active
minute creatures of the most varied
forms. These animalcules are found
also in the stagnant pools around
our cities, in the waters of rivers,
harbours, and lakes, and even in the
ocean.</p>

<p>In reference to the origin of
these animalcules, the view was long
entertained that they were generated
spontaneously, that the decaying
vegetable and animal substances were
decomposed and resolved into these simple beings. More accurate experiments
have shown, however, that the infusoria are produced from ova, or
germs, which are probably carried about in the dried-up state, in the form of
minute particles of dust,<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> ready to develop themselves in any spot which
may afford them the requisite moisture and nutriment. In this respect they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[Pg 708]</a></span>
resemble the microscopic fungi, whose germs are diffused in the same way.
When once they have obtained the means of development, they multiply
with incredible celerity. If the decaying vegetable or animal substances be
carefully excluded from contact with the air, or if the air be heated before
it is admitted to them, no infusoria will appear. They are rarely developed
on mountains of a certain height, where the atmosphere is free from foreign
bodies.</p>

<p>Though these animalcules are so exceedingly minute, yet the forms
exhibited by them are extremely various, and some of
them present also considerable variety in the forms
assumed by the same individual under different circumstances.
In many species the soft body is enclosed
in a firm integument, strengthened by a deposit of siliceous
matter; these envelopes, which are often preserved
after the death of the animals, are termed the <em>shields</em>,
and the animalcules encased in them are called <em>loricated</em>
infusoria. The remarkable discovery has been made that
large distinct beds of former formations are entirely made up of the accumulated
remains of these animalcules.</p>

<p>We arrive at the <span class="smcap">Hydrozoa</span> after leaving the Infusoria, and find
ourselves in the sea, and far from land, where it will be difficult for us
to ascertain the characteristics of these interesting animals. But fortunately
we can obtain much nearer home, and occasionally in a private
aquarium, a specimen of the hydrozoa which will serve our purpose,
as it has served before to introduce readers to the study of these water-polypes,
some of which are so like plants that they are frequently mistaken
for them.</p>

<p>The hydrozoa present a “definite histological structure,” says Professor
Huxley; “the body always exhibits a separation into
at least two distinct layers of tissue, an outer and an
inner.” The Hydras, or fresh-water polypes, which may
be found in nearly every pond adhering to the duckweed,
appears like tubes, and if touched will curl up
into tiny knobs. But if let alone they will adhere to a
glass by their single foot, or sucker, which can be
moved at pleasure.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_708b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 832.—The hydra.</div>
</div>

<p>The foot, or sucker, is continued to a slender
cylindrical stalk, from the end of which radiate a
number of tentacles, or “feelers,” growing around the
mouth, and serving to convey or attract food to the
animal which is, so to speak, all stomach. There is
no breathing apparatus, and what food it cannot digest
is expelled from the mouth. The peculiarity which
has given the hydra its name is, that no matter into how many pieces you
cut this polype, the parts cut off will all develop into little polypes perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[Pg 709]</a></span>
as their parent.<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> But germination is carried on naturally by buds thrown
out, and cast (by “gemmation”), or by the ordinary sexual production
of ova.</p>

<p>The outer and inner skins of the hydra are called the ectoderm and
endoderm, and the animal is quite capable of locomotion, walking, or rather
moving, backwards, by raising and planting its sucker or foot, and by
swimming. The prey is captured by the tentacles and by the darting out
of tiny spears from the cells or “thread cells” which contain them on the
surface of the body. The well-known “Portuguese man-of-war,” an ocean
polype, has these “harpoons” greatly developed, and can inflict serious pain
as of many stinging nettles; the sensation is
exceedingly painful, and lasts some time.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_709.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 833.—Medusa.</div>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Medusidæ</span> are known to the seaside
visitor as the jelly-fish, and the other <i>Acalephæ</i>,
the “hidden-eyed” medusæ, include the Portuguese
man-of-war mentioned above, and many
other umbrella-like animals. They have received
the name of medusæ from Medusa,
whose long, snaky locks the tentacles of the
animals are supposed to be like. Some of
these “floating umbrellas” are very dangerous,
and will inflict severe stings upon any one in
their vicinity. The tentacles or filaments
extend for a long distance, and bathers should
be cautious. We have often watched them,
and they are beautiful to contemplate particularly
at night, and in Kingstown Harbour,
near Dublin, many exceedingly fine specimens
have been obtained. The pulsation of the “umbrella” or bell, enables the
animal to swim, and the even undulations of this beautiful covering are
apparently caused by nervous contractions.</p>

<p>The jelly-fish have no resemblance to “fish,” and scarcely appear to
exist; they are of no use to man, and when removed from the water dwindle
by little and little to a tiny film and nothing more—they dissolve into air
and water. Cases have been known and tales told of how farmers collected
hundreds of these jelly-fish for manure, and when the cart reached the field,
to the man’s astonishment, nothing was left but what appeared cobweb in
the place of the load of fish.</p>

<p>The <em>Cyclippe</em> is a very common specimen, and moves by means of its
cilia; <em>Cestum Veneris</em>—the zone or girdle of Venus—is another curious
example. It appears like a glass ribbon about five inches wide and perhaps
four or five feet long. The cilia when in motion are very brilliant in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[Pg 710]</a></span>
colouring, and the creature undulates through the water in a remarkable
manner.</p>

<p>The luminosity of the medusæ is clearly perceived, the so-called phosphorescence
being due chiefly to the minute jelly-fish which abound near the
surface of the sea. It appears impossible, for most, at any rate, if not all,
these medusæ to sink beneath the surface, for they can be found in hundreds
cast ashore, melting away into film. We might imagine that they would be
provided with some means of sinking themselves, but being apparently only
air and water, it is necessary for them to remain upon the surface to exist
at all.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_710a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 834.—Sea cucumber.</div>
</div>

<p>The term <em>Acalephæ</em>, by which they are known, means “stinging” fish
or sea-nettles, the Greek word meaning nettle.</p>


<p>The <span class="smcap">Actinozoa</span> comprise corals and the popular sea anemones (actinidæ).
They resemble the hydrozoa in possessing tentacles, and also the two inner
and outer tissues of the body. But they differ
from the hydrozoa in their interior arrangement in
the possession of a kind of stomach between the
“body cavity” and the mouth which the hydrozoa
do not possess. The appearance of the sea
anemone is well known. It fixes itself by the
flat base and hangs out its tentacles to obtain food.
When we touch an anemone with a stick we
perceive how it contracts itself, but there is no
nervous system nor any respiration. The reproduction
of its species is carried on within, not as
in other animals, like the hydra, by exterior budding.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_710b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 835.—Coral.</div>
</div>

<p>The corals belong to the same class as the sea anemones, and are
called zoanthidæ. We have already in previous portions of this volume
mentioned the “coral” building polypes, but we may again describe them
here. We have the black coral or <em>antipathidæ</em>, which live in masses and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[Pg 711]</a></span>
united by a stem. They grow upon this fleshy trunk and cover it in time
“just as a trunk of a tree is covered by the
bark.” This stem is called a <em>cænosarc</em>, which
secretes the coral, or skeleton. The <em>madrepores</em>
are the greatest producers of the coral of
commerce.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_711a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 836.—Coral.</div>
</div>

<p>“If we examine a simple coral of this
group,” says Professor Nicholson, “we find that
we have to deal with an animal in all important
respects identical with an ordinary sea
anemone, but having a more or less complicated skeleton developed in its
interior.” This skeleton is the corallum, and it is composed, as most people
are aware, of calcareous matter deposited within the polype itself; in the
former case the development or formation is exterior to the polype. A
single polype will thus secrete a deposit, and a colony of them produce a
compound skeleton, and as they throw out buds or young polypes, the manufacture
of skeletons goes on by secretion.</p>

<p>The <em>Tubipores</em> are like pipes, and the coral has been termed the
“organ-pipe.” It is formed cylindrically and joined
externally. As under <span class="smcap">Geology</span> we have examined the
question of coral reefs, we need not here recapitulate the
descriptions given in that section.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_711b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 837.—Coral.</div>
</div>

<p>Doctor Bariel writes of these animals as follows:—“By
far the greater part of the Zoanthoid polypes, as they grow,
deposit in the cellular substance of the flesh of their back an
immense quantity of calcareous matter which enlarges as
the animal increases in size, and, in fact, fills up those portions
of the substance of the animal, which by the growth
of new parts are no longer wanted for its nourishment, and
in this manner they form a hard and strong case, amongst
the folds of which they contract themselves so as to be protected
from external injury, and by the same means they
form for themselves a permanent attachment which prevents their being
tossed about by every wave of the element in which they live. The stony
substances so formed are called corals, and their mode of formation causes
them exactly to represent the animal which secretes them. The upper surface
is always furnished with radiating plates, the remains of the calcareous
particles which are deposited in the longitudinal folds of the stomach.”</p>

<small>ECHINODERMATA—ANNULOSA—ENTOZOA—INSECTA.</small></h2>

<p class="hang">SEA-URCHINS—STAR-FISHES—FEATHERY STARS—SEA-CUCUMBERS—WORMS—LEECHES—ROTIFERS—TAPE
WORMS—INSECTS.</p>


<p>The <span class="smcap">Echinodermata</span> or spiny-skinned, are most commonly represented
by the sea-urchins and star-fishes of our coasts. In some of the classes
locomotion is performed by means of these spines or prickles, which serve as
legs. In others, movement is carried on by suckers and tubes as in the
star-fishes, these tubes being also the means whereby the animal obtains its
food.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_712.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 838.—Sea-urchin (echinus), with and without spines.</div>
</div>

<p>They have a digestive system, and possess a curiously horny skin even
when spines are absent. The mouth is in the centre. We give an illustration
of the sea-urchin, and of a section of a spine, which is a beautiful
object when seen under the microscope, for these spines can be made quite
transparent when cut across and ground. The shelly covering is porous,
and as the animal grows the shell is added to at the edges. Underneath
will be found the mouth, which has teeth fitted for devouring the small
crustacea. These sea-urchins abound, and their porous shells may be picked
up frequently after a storm.</p>

<p>The star-fishes are well known to all searchers amongst the rocks and
those who study the shore, and are often taken home for an aquarium.
They are very voracious, however, and when one is examined in a glass of
sea-water, the observer will detect many suckers protruding from each of
the rays. It is by means of these suckers, which are put forth from
innumerable little holes called “ambulacral apertures,” that the star-fish
makes his way up the rocks and along the ocean bed. The stomach of the
star-fish is extensive, and situated in the centre of the rays wherein is a
digestive apparatus. The rays are composed of detached but beautifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[Pg 713]</a></span>
fitted pieces, so united as to be flexible, and around the mouth and in
strong frame-work. The star-fish has no teeth, but manages to dispose of a
vast quantity of matter, which if left alone would be injurious in decay.</p>

<p>Thus Nature has provided a shore scavenger to devour what would be
harmful, just as the vulture on land eats the carrion. Besides this kind of
refuse food, the star-fish eats small crustaceans, and oysters fall victims to him.
By embracing the shell the star-fish manages to insert itself, and if it cannot
bring the oyster out to its mouth, it will quietly turn out its mouth into the
oyster-shell, and save the bivalve any trouble in the matter. Some writers
declare that the star-fish stupefies or poisons its victim, and then the shell
opens. These asteroidea can reproduce a ray that has been injured or cut
off, or they can break themselves to pieces if caught.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_713.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 839.—Spine of echinus (<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, natural size; <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, a section
magnified).</div>
</div>

<p>The brittle stars and feather stars appertain to the order of the
Ophiuroida or “serpent-armed,” because the rays are more flexible and thin
than the common star-fish. But they differ very much from the star-fish in
the arrangement, as well as in the shape of their arms. The former
possesses rays which form an appendage
of the stomach and enclose it. In the
brittle stars the rays are limbs, and could
be detached without taking the life of
the animal, except in so far as to deprive
it of means to obtain its food.
The body is quite independent of the
rays, the mouth occupying the centre,
and is surrounded by minute suckers.
The stars are much more flexible than
the star-fishes, their rays are longer,
and serve either as feet, fins, tentacles,
or arms.</p>

<p>The crinoids also belong to the Echinodermata, and resemble plants
more than star-fish. They are fixed upon a stalk like a flower, growing
upright from the sea-bottom, and the body is called a <em>calyx</em>, which is composed
of a ventral and dorsal surface. The arms branch out from the calyx,
just as a small tree does, and if we can imagine one of the last planted trees
on the Thames embankment reduced to half a finger’s length or less, we
have a sort of idea of the crinoid “in the rough.”</p>

<p>A polype supported on a stem branching out in feathery, grassy-looking
arms represents the Encrinites, the remains of which are found as fossils.
The arms of the crinoids are subdivided, and quite a flowery crown may in
time result. The animal obtains its food by the motion of cilia. The stem
and the branches are jointed, as it were, and capable of flexible movement
in any direction. The crinoids remain stationary during their lives.</p>

<p>The care taken by the star-fish of its young is remarkable. It carries
the eggs about in its suckers and with great caution. The young remain
attached to the mother until they are able to go about alone, and then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[Pg 714]</a></span>
physical attachments die off, and the asteroidea goes forth to seek its fortune in
the sea.</p>

<p>The echinus, already mentioned, is a most elaborately constructed
animal; the plates being secreted from the soft parts are ever being renewed
as the animal gets older and larger. The whole subject is well worth a
long independent study, of which it is here impossible for us to give the
results.</p>

<p>The sea-cucumbers are more like the familiar garden slug than any
other animal, and are surmounted by a fringe round the mouth which looks
like leaves. The surface is moist, and has no horny covering like the
“urchin,” or star fish, but the suckers are present and are used for locomotion.
The tentacles round the mouth serve as prehensile organs. The “alimentary
canal” is most curiously curved, and of great length, and the animal can
turn itself “inside out” with great facility if alarmed. It possesses a kind
of breathing apparatus, and may be classed as the most highly organized
of all the Echinodermata. These cucumbers are much esteemed by the
Chinese, and “trepang,” as they are called, are caught by thousands in
Australian waters.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Annulosa.</span></p>

<p>The worm-like animals are divided into sections, which include intestinal
worms, entozoa, annelida, and
crustacea, with the worms, spiders,
and insects classed in each section.
We may at once perceive what a
very extensive division the <i>Annulosa</i>
is, and we must devote some space
to it.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_714.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 840.—Earth worm (<i>lumbricus terrestris</i>), leech (<i>hirudo
medicinale</i>).</div>
</div>

<p>The <em>Rotifers</em>, or “wheel animalculæ,”
are included in this class;
they stand almost alone, and certainly
invisible to the naked eye.
They are very curious animals, as
will be seen from the accompanying
illustration. The motion of
the cilia around the mouth gives the whirling movement from which their
name is derived (fig. 841).</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Annelides</span>, or worms, include earth-worms, water-worms, leeches,
etc. The appearance of the earth-worm is so common that few people
comparatively studied it until Mr. Darwin’s book took the amateur reader
by surprise and delighted him, and to that volume we must refer our readers
for details of these very interesting animals, termed annelides because of the
rings appearing upon their bodies.</p>

<p>The common <em>leech</em> is well known in medicine. It is curiously enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[Pg 715]</a></span>
an inhabitant of ponds and lakes, and in such conditions has no opportunities
for tasting the warm blood for which it develops such a liking when opportunity
offers. This is really a remarkable fact, that the animal should be
placed in a position naturally in which its most natural tendencies should
remain unsatisfied.</p>

<p>The progression of the leech is performed by undulating movements
and the prehensile action of the suckers—head and tail. The eyes are ten
in number, near the mouth and at the top of the head. The mouth is
furnished with numerous tri-radiate teeth, but in some leeches they are not
sharp, as in the “medicinal” variety. It is known that both sexes are represented
in every leech, but they are not self-reproductive.</p>

<p>The earth-worm, so familiar to all, has been lately raised into importance.
It lives in clay, and bores its way through the ground. It feeds
upon organic matter contained in the earth, and when it has assimilated the
nourishing particles, it ejects the remainder in small heaps of soft dirt, which
are visible after rain particularly. The worm, by its burrowing, turns up
the land, and vastly increases its fertility.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_715.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 841.—Wheel animalcule (<i>rotifer vulgaris</i>).</div>
</div>

<p>The earth-worm in its outer structure resembles the leech, but, as any one
will at once perceive, the worm is not furnished with suckers by which it
can assist itself to move. Instead of these rounded terminals the worm is
finely pointed, and thus capable of boring its way through the earth. Progression
is accomplished by moving first the head portion and then the next,
so that a regular series of movements is necessary. The minute spines or
bristles of the worm prevent its body being retracted by muscular effort.</p>

<p>The vital organs are rather forward of the centre of the body, and so
if a worm be cut behind them it will survive and reproduce a tail. But the
portion cut off will not be found alive, nor is it capable of forming a new
perfect worm as generally supposed.</p>

<p>There are many other orders of worms which we can only indicate—viz.,
the <em>Tubicolæ</em> which surround themselves with a hard case; the <em>Errantia</em>,
or sea-worms, sand-worms, etc., like the lobworm used for bait, and the
naiads of our fresh-water ponds, all of which are suited to the aquatic life they
lead. Indeed, of all the annelides, the earth-worm is the only specimen
that is suited for living upon land. As regards the last mentioned, we may
add that worms do not prey upon dead bodies as is so generally imagined.
They are vegetable feeders, and do not burrow very deeply.</p>

<p>The transparent condition of the Rotifers renders them easy of observation
under the microscope, and we find a nervous system, intestines, and a
developed stomach. They are fresh-water inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[Pg 716]</a></span></p>

<p>The Entozoa or “intestinal” worms claim a brief notice at our hands.
The entozoa are those beings which inhabit, as parasites, the intestines and
other parts of animals. Their history is still obscure, but there seems to be
about twenty varieties of these creatures, and a great number of animals
have their peculiar entozoa. The best known in the human subject are
the “Ascaris” or thread-worm, the “Lumbricus Teres” or long-worm, and
the “Tænia” or tape-worm; this last is jointed, and grows to several yards
in length.</p>

<p>The development of these Tænia is one of the most curious performances
of nature. Each of the joints shown in the illustration below
(fig. 842) is a perfected and mature proglottis, containing the ova or eggs,
which can only be brought to perfection when swallowed by a warm-blooded
animal (not the same from which they emanated). The head within the
embryo then holds to the tissues and penetrates to the alimentary canal,
where only it can redevelop joints from the so-called head, which has no
organs and merely pushes out immature joints which are continued, and
they become more mature the farther they are pushed out by the new ones.
The “measles” of the pig are produced by the ova of these worms.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_716.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 842.—Tape worm (<i>proglottides</i>).</div>
</div>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Myriapoda.</span></p>

<p>The “many-footed” annulosa include the centipedes and millipedes, and
may be regarded as a connecting link between the worms and the insects.
The heads of these animals are distinct from the body.</p>

<p>The millipedes can be any day found under a large stone in a field
which has not been tilled, or any place where a stone has been suffered to
remain for some time undisturbed. These specimens are of the pill-millipede
order, because they roll themselves up into a ball when disturbed.
The myriapods of this country are not of large dimensions, but in tropical
climates they attain a great size. The giant centipede has been found in
South America more than a foot long, and is capable of inflicting severe
wounds, its tenacity being extraordinary and equalling that of the bull-dog
when once it has gripped its enemy.</p>

<p>The myriapods have no wings; they possess antennæ, and numerous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[Pg 717]</a></span>
never less than eighteen, feet,—frequently twenty pairs, but never a
thousand, much less “ten thousand” feet, as the class name indicates. They
are provided with strong forceps or “foot-jaws,” which supply a poison for
killing their enemies. The millipedes and centipedes are known scientifically
as Iulidæ and Scolopendridæ respectively, and in most points of internal
arrangement resemble insects, such as breathing by spiracles or (stomates),
and trachæ or tubes. Some of the centipedes possess electric qualities, and
can administer a shock to an opponent.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Insecta.</span></p>

<p>Insects inhabit the world around us in myriad forms in air and earth
and water. Some exist for a very brief space in the air; others live under
water, or in trees, or in the ground; some burrow and hide in chinks of
rocks and under stones. The numbers are countless, and all have some
function to perform as palpably as the busy honey-bee, or as mysteriously as
the giddy, careless butterfly.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_717.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 843.—Anatomy of the external skeleton of an insect.</div>
</div>

<p>Insects are divided into three distinct parts,—viz., the <em>head</em>, the <em>thorax</em>,
and the <em>abdomen</em>, and each of these parts has a pair of legs attached to it, as
will be perceived from the accompanying diagram. Along the body are
tubes called trachæ,—for insects do not breathe by lungs,—by which the air is
carried into the system of the insect, by the “spiracles” or openings of fine
network, to prevent dust entering the air-passages. The head is joined to
the body by a constricted neck, the part of the body to which it is joined is
called the thorax, and to this is added the posterior part or abdomen; this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">[Pg 718]</a></span>
part is extremely various in form in different insects; in some it is round and
full, in others long and extended. The antennæ arise from the head, and
are generally composed of eleven pieces variously disposed; these wonderful
organs are possessed of great sensibility, and they certainly serve to convey
information to the insect, of the nature of one of the special senses; it was
formerly thought to be simply that of touch
very much refined, or of smell, but it is now
generally considered to be that of hearing, or
a modification of it. The forms of the antennæ
are very various; fig. 845
represents that of the cockchafer
(<i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>).
The legs proceed from the
thorax as do the wings, the
abdomen giving rise to none
of the extremities; the feet
of insects are all pretty
much upon the same model, some being more
developed than others, they have a pair of
hooks or claws for catching and clinging to rough surfaces, and a pair of
cushions or pads, covered in some cases with suckers.</p>

<p>The foot of the common house-fly is most beautifully fitted for its
progression and support. We have often wondered how the fly manages to
support itself back downwards on the ceiling, or walk up glass. We give a
cut of the fly’s foot (fig. 846).</p>

<p>The eyes of insects are also marvellous. There are only two, but each
one is composed of numerous cells (ocelli), and look like a honey-comb. (<i>See</i>

<p>Insects swarm in innumerable companies, and no one who has not seen
the locusts descending upon the earth can form more than a faint idea of
the devastation they occasion in an incredibly short time. These, as well as
thousands of other insects, exist in myriads, and we must content ourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">[Pg 719]</a></span>
on this occasion, by merely noting the different orders and their characteristics,
after we have mentioned some of the attributes common to all.</p>

<p>The term “insect” means cut into or divided, and so the insecta are
divided, as already mentioned, into three parts,—head, thorax, and abdomen,—the
thorax being subdivided into three rings, <em>pro</em>-thorax, <em>meso</em>-thorax, and
<em>meta</em>-thorax—beginning, middle, and end. All insects have six legs, and
usually two or four wings, though some have no wings at all. The legs are
united to the <em>thorax</em>, the antennæ and eyes to the head. The abdomen
contains the important sexual organs, a sting or defensive weapon, and in
females the egg chamber.</p>

<p>Insects breathe by tubes in the sides, and consume a great quantity of
air. Their powers of flying and leaping are too familiar to need dwelling
upon. The wings display beautiful colours like those observable in the
soap-bubble, others are covered with scales or hairs. The mouths vary very
much with the species, as the manner of obtaining food is by suction or
gnawing. The blood of insects is pale and thin.</p>

<p>The various transformations which insects undergo are always a subject
of interest for the young student. The ugly forms which develop in
beautiful creations are more astonishing than the change of the “ugly duckling”
into the graceful swan.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 849.—Pupa.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Insects come to maturity only after undergoing successive changes
from the egg to the perfect animal. The eggs (some of which are very
beautiful) are first deposited in some safe place, either attached to a leaf or
tied up in a small bundle by silken threads spun by the parent insect, and in
some nutritious substance, so that when it comes to life it may at once have
food; this is sometimes in manure, sometimes in flesh, and sometimes under
the skin of a living animal (few are exempt from this infliction), where they
remain for a time and then come forth as maggots, caterpillars, etc.; in this
state they are called <em>larvæ</em>,—these are generally active creatures and eat most
voraciously, which seems to be the principal act of this state of their existence.
These larvæ frequently change their skins as they grow, and at last
they assume the next stage of their life, the <em>pupa</em> or chrysalis state, which is
one generally of complete inactivity; many of these larvæ weave themselves
a covering of a sort of silk, to defend them while in the pupa state,—such
as the silkworm, whose covering (cocoon) is the source of all the silk of
commerce,—others merely place themselves in a situation of security. The
pupa remains dormant for a certain time, and then becomes the <em>imago</em> or
perfect insect (the last state of its existence), such as a moth, a butterfly, a
beetle, etc. These are of different sexes, and in due time produce a batch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">[Pg 720]</a></span>
of eggs and then die; these eggs are often incredible in numbers, amounting
to many thousands—but few escape the watchful eyes of other insects and
of birds who feed upon them.</p>

<p>But there are some of the insecta which do not undergo metamorphosis;
the <span class="smcap">Aptera</span> or wingless insects
include these, as the flea and such
parasites which bore into other
animals, and deposit their eggs within
them.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<div class="caption">Fig. 850.—Imago.</div>
</div>

<p>Insects have very little means
for making themselves audible, at
least so far as can be ascertained.
The humming of bees and flies and
other insects are, of course, not
intended to represent the voice. The
cricket’s “chirp,” as people commonly
imagine, but the sound is attributable to the rubbing together of the wings
or wing-cases, as is the noise produced by the field-cricket. There is a
very peculiar sound attributable to the “Death-Watch,” a ticking, and to
nervous people terrible warning of dissolution. It may reassure some one,
perhaps, to know that this “unearthly sound” is caused simply by the
insect beating its head against a piece of wood to attract its mate, as the
female glow-worm lights her lamp to guide her lord to her bower.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Insecta</span> may simply be divided into nine orders:—</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 851.—The Stag-Beetle (<i>Lucanus cervus</i>).</div>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Coleoptera</span> are well represented
in England as beetles. They have
four wings, but the outer pair serve as
coverings to the inner ones. They are
termed <i>Elytra</i>, and are horny in texture.
These beetles are short-lived, but useful
as scavengers, and serve to manure the
ground by burying objectionable matter.
The larvæ of beetles eat tremendously.
The stag-beetle is a formidable-looking
animal, and the lady-bird is well known
as an enemy to the aphides on our rose
trees. The tiger-beetle, cockchafer, and various water-beetles belong to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_721" id="Page_721">[Pg 721]</a></span>
this family. The scarabee, or sacred Egyptian beetle, also will be found
classed with the coleoptera. Many of these beetles are excellent scavengers,
and some called burying beetles remove the soil underneath the carcases
of birds and other small dead animals, letting them fall down below the
ground level; the beetles then lay their eggs in the body, so that sustenance
may be at hand for the young when hatched.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Orthoptera</span> include our cockroaches, miscalled “black beetles,” the
locusts, crickets, etc. The ravages of the locust are well known. The larvæ
of the orthoptera has no wings, but otherwise is very like the grown insect.
They change their skins frequently before they become perfect insects.</p>

<p>Passing the “nerve-winged” dragon-flies and caddis, whose larvæ case
is so familiar and useful as bait, we come to the very important and interesting
order of <span class="smcap">Hymenoptera</span>, with four membranous wings. In this rank
we find bees, wasps, and ants, the first and last named being proverbial for
industry and examples of almost superhuman
reasoning powers, and a similitude
to man’s arrangements in labour and house-building
marvellous to contemplate. A
study of the habits of ants, bees, and wasps
will reveal a state of society existing amongst
them which more nearly resembles man in
feelings and habits, for these insects possess
means of oral communication.</p>

(<i>Halictus</i>), (<i>a</i>, magnified; <i>a</i> <i>b</i>, more highly
magnified).</p></div>
</div>

<p>All these insects are armed with a
sting, or other offensive weapon. The ant
possesses the “formic” acid, which derives
its name from the possessor. The destructive
white ants will eat away a wooden
house very quickly, sapping and mining it
in all directions
till it
is a mere
skeleton. The habits of bees are so well
known and have been so often described
that we need not detail them. The manner
in which the ants “milk” the aphides is
curious and interesting.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Strepsiptera</span> order includes very
few species, so we may pass quickly to the
<span class="smcap">Lepidoptera</span>, the butterflies and moths,
whose beautiful colourings and markings have
attracted us all from childhood. There are
about 12,000 species of the lepidoptera, and they are divided into “moths”
and “butterflies,” the former being seen in twilight, or darkness, the latter
in sunlight. They can readily be distinguished by the antennæ, those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[Pg 722]</a></span>
the butterfly being tipped, or knobbed. The silkworm belongs to this
family. These insects undergo complete metamorphosis. The remaining
two orders of insects include the house-flies and gnats; and the flea, and
jigger, or chigo, which penetrates the skin and lays its eggs in the flesh,
causing thereby dangerous inflammation.</p>

</div>

<p>This class includes a number of familiar animals such as the barnacle,
the crab, the lobster, shrimp, etc.;
and curious as it may appear are
closely related to our spiders. Their
cases or coverings are all articulated
or disposed in distinct segments.
They breathe through gills or by
tubes, and possess legs, or appendages
for walking, eating, or guidance.
They are generally marine creatures.</p>

<p>The shell of the crustacea is
composed largely of lime, and of
course becomes very hard in time.
It is formed from the skin. The
body, like that of an insect, is composed
of head, thorax, and abdomen,
divided into twenty-one segments, of which seven occupy the head, seven the
thorax, and the remainder the abdomen. Twenty segments are furnished with
legs, or feelers, or claws—a pair to a segment. The lobster or crayfish will
give excellent examples of the anatomy of the <em>macrura</em> or lobster kind of
crustacea. The heart is situated in the back.</p>

<p>The following table given by Professor Nicholson will explain the
“segments and appendages” of the lobster:—</p>

<p>The tail is, as may be supposed, the great aid to locomotion in the
lobster family, and they can swim backwards with great rapidity by its
assistance. Lobsters shed their claws when alarmed, and are easily caught
by a glittering bait.</p>

<p>The hermit crabs are interesting creatures, but do not possess the horny
coat of the crab or lobster. They are therefore compelled to inhabit an
empty shell, into which they thrust themselves, holding to the bottom of it
by their tail, while a large claw guards the entrance. When the animal gets
too big for his house he moves to another, leaving the old home for another
hermit of the shore.</p>

<p>The crabs have no developed tails, and are therefore called brachyura—“short-tailed,”
and they are walking creatures. There are king crabs, land
crabs, and the common swimming crab. These animals can shed their
shells as other crustaceans, and a curious fact is they shed them whole.
How the claws come out must remain more or less a mystery. Réaumur
investigated the action of the crayfish, and noticed that as the casting time
approached the crustacea retired to some hiding-place and remained without
eating. The shell becomes gradually loosened, and at last by putting its
feet against a stone and pushing backwards the animal jerks himself away.
It must be a painful operation, for the mill-like teeth of the stomach are
also rejected, and the joints do not give way. After a while a new shell
appears, and is cast in due time as before.</p>

<p>The eyes of the crustacea are situated in front, and are composed like
the insects, or are simple, like spiders. They possess a sense of hearing evidently.
The eggs of the lobster are carried by the female, and they are
termed the “coral” in consequence of their red and beadlike appearance.
Our space will not admit of our saying much more concerning the interesting
crustacea, though the barnacles, so well known by sight by all dwellers
at the sea, and called Cirripedia, which fix themselves to rocks and ships,
deserve notice. The young are capable of movement, and this fact was first
discovered in 1830. It resembled a mussel, but when kept in sea-water it
adhered to the vessel which retained it. The cirripedia are so called from
the cirri or arms which they possess, and by which they are enabled to
entangle or catch their food, as in a net. They hold themselves by a
“foot stalk.” The goose-mussel, or barnacle, is very common, but must not
be confounded with the limpet.</p>

<p>Dr. Baird gives the following description of them:—“The cirripeds
are articulated animals contained within a hard covering composed of several
pieces and consisting of calcified chitine. The body of the animal is
enclosed in a sac lined with the most delicate membrane of chitine, which
in one group is prolonged into a peduncle and contains the ova; the body
is distinctly articulated and placed with the back downwards.</p>

<p>There are many families of arachnida besides the well-known garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[Pg 724]</a></span>
and house spiders. The sea spiders, though classed with the arachnida, are
sometimes placed amongst the crustacea. We have the “tick” and the
cheese-mite and the scorpions; all of which belong to the spider family.
But the true spiders are known by the joining of the two upper segments,
the thorax and head being united (cephalo-thorax). The pretty and marvellous
webs are spun from abdominal glands through small apertures.
The fluid hardens in its passage
sufficiently to be woven into threads
to resist the struggles of the captured
prey. The forms of these webs vary,
but some spiders do not catch their
victims in the net; they pounce upon
them cat fashion. The large house
spider is well known to all. The
garden spider is seen in the illustration
(fig. 855) with the scorpion.
The habits of spiders will be found
a very interesting study, and many
volumes have been devoted to them.
The water spider is a frequent
inmate of an aquarium, and the
bubble of air he takes down with
him to breathe serves as a means of
living while he is seeking his aquatic prey.</p>

<p>We will close our rapid survey of the invertebrate animals with a glance
at the <span class="smcap">Mollusca</span>, which are divided into six classes (<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_703">page 703</a>). The
first is the Tunicata, which have no shell or hard covering, and come under
the denomination of molluscoids, and belong to a lower order. The true
mollusca include the Brachiopoda, which have a pair of shells. They are
called “arm-footed” because a long
cord or tendon passes through one
of the shells, and fixes the mollusc
to the rock. The Lingula of this
class have been discovered in very
old formations such as the Devonian
period, and indeed appear to have
been amongst the first created
animals.</p>

</div>

<p>The Lamellibranchiata include
the oyster, cockle, mussel, etc.
They are well known, and scarcely
need description. The Pteropoda
have no shell. The Gasteropoda are very numerous, and periwinkles, whelks,
snails, etc., belong to this class. They progress by a muscular “mantle,”
which is extended and contracted. The “horns” have eyes at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">[Pg 725]</a></span>
extremities. When they retire into their “houses” they can close the door
by a kind of lid called the “operculum.”</p>

<p>The Cephalopods include the nautilus and the cuttle fish, the terrible
squid, or octopus, etc. Wonderful tales are told of the tenacity and ferocity
of the “Poulpes,” and no doubt in long-past ages these animals attained a
gigantic growth. They are very unpleasant enemies, and the cold, slimy
grasp of the long tentacles is apt to give one the “horrors,” while the
terrible head and beak fill one with dismay. The poulpes are very formidable
opponents, and discretion will certainly be the better part of valour
when they appear in our vicinity.</p>

<p>We must here close our sketch of the Invertebrates, and we regret that
the limits of our volume will not permit us to continue this interesting subject,
nor can we find space, at present, for even the barest description of the
Vertebrate animals.</p>

<small>THE ANALYSIS OF CHANCE AND MATHEMATICAL GAMES.</small></h2>

<p class="hang">MAGIC SQUARES—THE SIXTEEN PUZZLE—SOLITAIRE—EQUIVALENTS.</p>


<p>We will now proceed to draw our readers’ attention to several experiments
very famous at a former period, but which our own generation has completely
overlooked. We refer to the Analysis of Chance, a science still known
under the title of <em>Calculation of Probabilities</em>, formerly cultivated with so
much ardour, but to-day almost fallen into oblivion.</p>

<p>Originating in the caprice of the clever Chevalier de Méré, who in
1654 suggested the game to Pascal, the analysis of chance has given rise to
investigations of an entirely novel kind, and attempts have been made to
measure the mathematical degree of credence to be given to simple conjectures.
We will first recapitulate the principles laid down by Laplace on
this subject. We know that of a certain number of events, one only can
happen, but nothing leads us to the belief that one will happen more than
the other. The theory of chance consists in reducing all the events of the
same kind to a certain number of equally possible cases, such, that is to
say, that we are equally undecided about, and to determine the number of
cases favourable to the event, whose probability we are seeking. The ratio
of this number to that of all possible cases is the measure of this probability,
which is thus a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of favourable
cases, and the denominator the number of all possible cases. When all the
cases are favourable to an event, its probability changes to certainty,
and it is then expressed by the unit. Probabilities increase or
diminish by their mutual combination; if the events are independent of each
other, the probability of the existence of their whole is the product of their
particular probabilities. Thus the probability of throwing an ace with one
dice being 1/6, that of throwing two aces with two dice is 1/36. Each of the sides
of one dice combining with the six sides of the other, there are thirty-six
possible cases, among which one only gives the two aces. When two events
depend on each other, the probability of the double event is the product of
the probability of the first event by the probability that, that event having
occurred, the other will occur. This rule helps us to study the influence of
past events on the probability of future events. If we calculate <i lang="la">á priori</i> the
probability of the event that has occurred and an event composed of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">[Pg 727]</a></span>
and another expected event, the second probability divided by the first, will
be the probability of the expected event, inferred from the observed event.</p>

<p>The probability of events serves to determine the hope or fear of
persons interested in their existence. The word <em>hope</em> here expresses the
advantage which someone expects in suppositions which are only probable.
This advantage in the theory of chances is the product of the hoped-for
sum by the probability of obtaining it; it is the partial sum which should arise
when one does not wish to run the risks of the event, supposing that the apportionment
corresponds to the probabilities. This apportionment is only
equitable when we abstract from it all foreign circumstances; because an equal
degree of probability gives an equal title to the hoped-for sum. This advantage
is called <em>mathematical hope</em>. Nevertheless, the rigorous application of this
principle may lead to an inadmissible consequence. Let us see what Laplace
says. Paul plays at heads and tails, on the understanding that he receives
two shillings if he succeeds at the first throw, four shillings if he succeeds at
the second, eight at the third, and so on. His stake on the game, according
to calculation, must be equal to the number of throws; so that if the game
continues indefinitely, the stake also continues indefinitely. Yet, no reasonable
man would venture on this game even a moderate sum, £2 for example.
Whence, therefore, comes this difference between the result of the calculation,
and the indication of common-sense? We soon perceive that it proceeds
from the fact, that the moral advantage which a benefit procures for us is
not proportional to this advantage, and that it depends on a thousand
circumstances, often very difficult to define, but the chief and most important
of which is chance. In fact, it is evident that a shilling has much greater
value for one who has but a hundred than for a millionaire. We must,
therefore, distinguish in the hoped-for good between its absolute and its
relative value; the latter regulates itself according to the motives which
cause it to be desired, while the former is independent. In the absence of a
general principle to appreciate this relative value, we give a suggestion of
Daniel Bernouilli which has been generally admitted.</p>

<p>The relative value of an extremely small sum is equal to its absolute
value, divided by the total advantage of the interested person. On applying
the calculus to this principle, it will be found that the <em>moral hope</em>, the growth
of chance due to expectations, coincides with the mathematical hope, when
chance, considered as a unit, becomes infinite in proportion to the variations
it receives from expectations. But when these variations are a sensible
portion of the unit, the two hopes may differ very greatly from each other.
In the example cited, this rule leads to results conformable to the indications
of common-sense. We find, in point of fact, that if Paul’s fortune amounts
only to £8, he cannot reasonably stake more than 7<i>s.</i> on the game. At
the most equal game, the loss is always, relatively greater than the gain.
Supposing, for example, that a person possessing a sum of £4, stakes £2 on
a game of heads or tails, his money after placing his stake will be <i>morally</i>
reduced to £3 11<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>—that is to say, <em>this latter sum will procure him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[Pg 728]</a></span>
same moral advantage as the condition of his funds after his stake</em>. Whence
we draw this conclusion: that the game is disadvantageous, even in the
cases where the stake is equal to the product of the sum hoped for by the
probability. We may, therefore, form an idea of the immorality of games
in which the hoped-for sum is below this product.</p>

<p>Jacques Bernouilli has thus laid down the result of his investigations
on the calculation of probabilities. An urn containing white and black
balls is placed in front of the spectator, who draws out a ball, ascertaining
its colour, and puts it back in the urn. After a sufficient number of draws,
the total number of <em>extracted</em> balls divided by the total number of balls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">[Pg 729]</a></span>
represents a fraction very near to that which has for a numerator the real
number of white balls existing in the urn, and for the denominator the total
number of balls. In other words, the ratios of the number either of extracted
white balls, or the whole of the white balls to the total number, tend to
become equal; that is, the probability derived from this experiment
approaches indefinitely towards a certainty. The two fractions may differ
from each other as little as possible, if we increase the number of draws.
From this theorem we deduce several consequences.</p>

<p>1. The relations of natural effects are nearly constant when these
effects are considered in a great number.</p>

<p>2. In a series of events indefinitely prolonged, the action of regular and
constant causes affects that of irregular causes.</p>

<p><em>Applications.</em>—The combinations presented by these games have been
the subject of former researches regarding probabilities. We will complete
our exposition with two more examples.</p>

<p>Two persons, A and B, of equal skill, play together on the understanding
that whichever beats the other a certain number of times, shall be
considered to have won the game, and shall carry off the stakes. After
several throws the players agree to give up without finishing the game; and
the point then to be settled, is in what manner the money is to be divided
between them. This was one of the problems laid before Pascal by the
Chevalier de Méré. The shares of the two players should be proportional
to their respective probabilities of winning the game. These probabilities
depend on the number of points which each player requires to reach the given
number. A’s probabilities are determined by starting with the smallest
numbers, and observing that the probability equals the unit, when player A
does not lose a point. Thus, supposing A loses but one point, his chance is
1·2, 3·4, 7·8, etc., according as B misses one, two, or three points. Supposing
A has missed two points, it will be found that his chance is as 1·4, 1·2,
11·6, etc., according as B has missed one, two, or three points, etc. Or we
may suppose that A misses three points, and so on.</p>

<p>We should note, <i lang="fr">en passant</i>, that this solution has been modified by
Daniel Bernouilli, by the consideration of the respective fortune of the
players, from which he deduces the idea of moral hope. This solution,
famous in the history of science, bears the name of the <em>Petersburgh problem</em>,
because it was made known for the first time in the “Memoires de l’Académie
de Russie.”</p>

<p>We will now describe the <em>game of the needle</em>. It is a genuine mathematical
amusement, and its results, indicated by theory, are certainly calculated
to excite astonishment. The game of the needle is an application
of the different principles we have laid down.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 859.—The needle game.</div>
</div>

<p>If we trace on a sheet of paper a series of parallel and equi-distant
lines, <span class="smcap lowercase">AA1</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BB1</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">CC1</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">DD1</span>, and throw down on the paper at hazard a perfectly
cylindrical needle, <i>a b</i>, the length of which equals half the distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">[Pg 730]</a></span>
between the parallel lines (figs. 858 and 859), we shall discover this curious
result. If we throw down the needle a hundred times, it will come in contact
with one of the parallel lines a certain number of times. Dividing the
number of attempts with the number of successful throws, we obtain as a
quotient a number which approaches nearer the value of the ratio between
the circumference and the diameter in proportion as we multiply the number
of attempts. This ratio, according to the rules of geometry, is a fixed
number, the numerical value of which is 3·1415926. After a hundred
throws we generally find the exact value up to the two first figures: 3·1.
How can this unexpected result be explained? The application of the
calculus of probabilities gives the reason of it. The ratio between the
successful throws and the number of attempts, is the probability of this
successful throw. The calculation endeavours to estimate this probability
by enumerating the possible cases and the favourable events. The enumeration
of possible cases exacts the
application of the principle of
compound probabilities. It will
be easily seen that it suffices to
consider the chances of the needle
falling between two parallel lines,
<span class="smcap lowercase">AA1</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">BB1</span> (fig. 858), and then
to consider what occurs in the
interval, <i>m n</i>, equal to the equi-distance.
To obtain a successful
throw, it is necessary then:—</p>

<p>1. That the middle of the
needle should fall between <i>m</i>
and <i>l</i>, the centre of <i>m o</i>. 2. That
the angle of the needle with <i>m o</i>
will be smaller than the angle,
<i>m c b</i>. The calculation of all
these probabilities and their combination by multiplication, according to
the rules of compound probabilities, gives as the final expression of probability
the number.</p>

<p>This curious example justifies the theorem of Bernouilli relating to the
multiplication of events; there is no limit to the approximation of the
result, when the attempts are sufficiently prolonged. When the length of
the needle is not exactly half the distance between the parallel lines, the
practical rule of the game is as follows: The ratio between the number of
throws and the number of successful attempts must be multiplied by double
the ratio between the length of the needle and the distance between the
parallel lines. In the case cited above, the double of the latter ratio equals
the unit. We will give an application to this. A needle two inches long
is thrown 10,000 times on a series of parallel lines, two-and-a-half inches
apart; the number of successful throws has been found to equal 5000. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[Pg 731]</a></span>
take the ratio 1090/5009, and multiply it by the ratio 1000/636 and the product is
3·1421. The true value is 3·1415. We have an approximation of 6/10000.</p>

<p>The dimensions indicated in this experiment are those which present
in a given number of attempts the most chances of obtaining the greatest
possible approximation. We will conclude these remarks on games by some
observations borrowed from Laplace.</p>

<p>The mind has its illusions like the sense of sight; and just as the
sense of touch corrects the latter, reflection and calculation correct the
former. The probability founded on an every-day experience, or exaggerated
by fear or hope, strikes us as a superior probability, but is only a simple
result of calculation.</p>

<p>In a long series of events of the same kind, the mere chances of
accident sometimes offer these curious veins of good or bad fortune, which
many persons do not hesitate to attribute to a kind of fatality. It often
happens in games which depend both on chance and the cleverness of the
players, that he who loses, overwhelmed with his want of success, seeks to
repair the evil by rash playing, which he would avoid on another occasion;
he thus aggravates his own misfortune and prolongs it. It is then, however,
that prudence becomes necessary, and that it is desirable to remember that
the moral disadvantage attaching to unfavourable chances is increased also
by the misfortune itself.<a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Mathematical games, formerly so much studied,
have recently obtained a new addition in the form of an interesting
game, known as the “Boss” puzzle. It has been introduced from
America, and consists of a square box, in which are placed sixteen
small wooden dice, each bearing a number (fig. 860). No. 16 is
taken away, and the others are placed haphazard in the box, as shown in
fig. 861. The point is then to move the dice, one by one, into different
positions, so that they are at last arranged in their natural order, from one
to fifteen; and this must be accomplished by slipping them from square to
square without lifting them from the box. If the sixteenth dice is added,
the game may be varied, and we may seek another solution of the problem,
by arranging the numbers so that the sum of the horizontal, vertical, and
diagonal lines gives the number 34. In this form the puzzle is one of the
oldest known. It dates from the time of the primitive Egyptians, and has
often been investigated during the last few centuries, belonging, as it does,
to the category of famous <em>magic squares</em>, the principles of which we will
describe. The following is the definition given by Ozanam, of the Academy
of Sciences, at Paris, at the end of the seventeenth century. The term
<em>magic square</em> is given to a square divided by several small equal or broken
squares, containing terms of progression which are placed in such a manner
that all those of one row, either across, from top to bottom, or diagonally,
make one and the same sum when they are added, or give the same product
when multiplied. It is therefore evident from this definition, that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[Pg 732]</a></span>
are two kinds of magic squares, some formed by terms of arithmetical progression,
others by terms of geometrical progression. We must also
distinguish the equal from the unequal magic squares.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 861.—The numbers placed at hazard, and No. 16 removed.</div>
</div>

<p>We give here several examples of magic squares with terms of
mathematical progression, among them the square of 34, giving one of the
solutions to the puzzle just described (fig. 862). We also give an example
of a magic square composed of terms of geometrical progression. The
double progression for examples 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, as here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">[Pg 733]</a></span>
arranged (fig. 863), forms such a square that the product obtained by
multiplying the three terms of one row, or one diagonal, is 4,096, which is
the cube of the mean term 16. The squares have been termed <em>magic</em>,
because, according to Ozanam, they were held in great veneration by the
Pythagoreans. In the time of alchemy and astrology, certain magic squares
were dedicated to the seven planets, and engraved on a metal blade which
sympathized with the planet. To give an idea of the combinations to which
the study of magic squares lends itself, it is sufficient
to add that mathematicians have written
whole treatises on the subject. Frénicle de Bessy,
one of the most eminent calculators of the
seventeenth century, consecrated a part of his life
to the study of magic squares. He discovered new
rules, and found out the means of varying them in
a multitude of ways. Thus for the magic square,
the root of which is 4, only sixteen different
arrangements were known.</p>

<p>Frénicle de Bessy found 880 new solutions.
An important work from the pen of this learned mathematician has been
published under the title of “Carrés ou Tables Magiques,” in the “Memoirs
de l’Académie Royale des Sciences,” from 1666-1699, vol. v. Amateurs,
therefore, who are accused of occupying themselves with a useless game,
unworthy the attention of serious minds, will do well to bear in mind the
works of Frénicle, and better still, to consult them.</p>

<p>We have so far considered only the first part of the puzzle. We may
now examine the problem to which specially it has given rise. We are
quite in accord with M. Piarron de Mondesir, who has been so good as to enlighten
us upon the subject, which is really much more difficult than it appears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">[Pg 734]</a></span></p>

<p>A French paper once proposed to give a prize of 500 francs to any
individual who would solve the following problem:—</p>

<p>Throw the numbers out of the box, replace them at hazard, then in
arranging them place them in the following order (<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> fig. 864).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_734a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 864.—The Sixteen Puzzle.</div>
</div>

<p>Now nobody solved this problem, because in nine cases out of ten it is
impossible to do so. The first twelve numbers will come correctly into their
places, and even 13 can be put in its place without much trouble; but,
instead of getting the last row right we shall find it will come out like <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>,
viz., 14, 15, 13, in the large majority of instances. So any case can be
solved in one of the two results given above, and we can tell in advance,
without displacing a number, in which way the puzzle will eventuate.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 866.—Example 2.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Let us give this problem our attention for a few minutes, and we shall
not find it difficult.</p>

<p>Take the first example. We will throw the cubes out of the box and
put them back in the order shown in fig. 865.</p>

<p>We see now that 1 occupies the place of 11, 11 that of 7, 7 that of 8,
8 that of 6, 6 of 15, 15 of 1. This much is evident without any study.
We formulate these figures as follows, beginning with 1 and working from
figure to figure till we are led to 1 again, and so on.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>1st. Series.</i>—1, 11, 7, 8, 6, 15, 1  (6) even.<br />
</p>

<p>Counting the number of different cubes we have 6; and we put
(6) in a parenthesis. We call the first series even because 6 is an even
number.</p>

<p>We now establish, by the same formula, a second series commencing
with 2, <i>and going back to it</i>, thus—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">[Pg 735]</a></span></p>



<div class="center">
<table class="smaltab" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td align="left"><i>2nd Series.</i>—2, 4, 2</td>
  <td align="left">(2) even.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left"><i>3rd Series.</i>—3, 5, 10, 12, 3</td>
  <td align="left">(4) even.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left"><i>4th Series.</i>—9, 13, 14, 9</td>
  <td align="left">(3) uneven.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>


<p>We have now four series, the total number of points equal 15, as there
ought to be, for one cube is absent.</p>

<p>Let us now take another example (<i>see</i> fig. 866), and by working as
before we have four series again, viz:—</p>



<div class="center">
<table class="smaltab" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td align="left"><i>1st Series.</i>—1, 7, 1</td>
  <td align="left">(2) even.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left"><i>2nd Series.</i>—2, 11, 3, 8, 4, 15, 2</td>
  <td align="left">(6) even.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left"><i>3rd Series.</i>—5, 12, 13, 5</td>
  <td align="left">(3) uneven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left"><i>4th Series.</i>—9, 14, 10, 9</td>
  <td align="left">(3) uneven.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>


<p>This gives us only 14 as a total, because 6 has not been touched at all.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now for the rule, so that we may be able to ascertain in advance,
when we have established our series, whether we shall find our puzzle right
or wrong at the end. We must put aside all unplaced numbers and take no
notice of uneven series. Only the even series must be regarded.</p>

<p>Thus if we do not find 1, or if we find 2, 4, or 6, the problem will come
into <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> as a result. If we find 1, 3, 5, or 7, the case will eventuate as in <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>
(fig. 864). Let us apply the rule to the problems we have worked, and then
the reason will be apparent.</p>

<p>In the first we find <em>three even series</em>; the problem will then end as in
<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> diagram (fig. 864), for the number of <em>like</em> series is <em>odd</em>.</p>

<p>In the second we find <em>two even series</em> (pairs); we shall find our problem
work out as in diagram <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> (fig. 864), for the number of <em>like series</em> is <em>even</em>,
one pair in each.</p>

<p>We are now in possession of a simple rule, both rapid and infallible,
and which will save considerable trouble, as we can always tell beforehand
how our puzzle will come out. Any one can test the practicability of the
rules for himself, but we may warn the reader that he will never be able to
verify every possible instance, for the possible cases are represented by the
following sum—</p>

<p>
2×3×4×5×6×7×8×9×10×11×12×13×14×15.<br />
</p>

<p>That is to say, 1,307,674,368,000 in all.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Solitaire.</span></p>

<p>This somewhat ancient amusement is well known, and the apparatus
consists of a board with holes to receive pegs or cups to receive the balls, as
in the illustrations (figs. 867 and 870.) The usual solitaire board contains
thirty-seven pegs or balls, but thirty-three can also be played very well. Many
scientific people have made quite a study of the game, and have published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">[Pg 736]</a></span>
papers on the subject. M. Piarron de Mondesir has given two rules which
will prove interesting.</p>

<p>The first is called that of equivalents, and supposes the game to be
played out to a conclusion; the second, called the ring-game, admits of a
calculation being made so that the prospects of success can be gauged
beforehand.</p>

<p>The method of play is familiar, so we need not detail it. It is simply
“taking” the balls by passing over them in a straight line. The method of
“equivalents” consists in replacing one ball with two others, as we will
proceed to explain by the diagram (fig. 868).</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_736.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 867.—Solitaire.</div>
</div>

<p>Suppose we try the 33 game, which consists in filling every hole with
the exception of the centre one, and in “taking” all the balls, leaving one
solitary in the centre at the last. Suppose an inexperienced player arrives
at an impossible solution of five balls in 4, 11, 15, 28, and 30.</p>

<p>To render the problem soluble, and to win his game, I will replace
No. 11 by two equivalents, 9 and 10, the ball 28 by two others, 23 and
16, and the ball 30 by 25 and 18. These substitutions will not change the
“taking off,” for I can take 10 with 9, 23 with 16, and 25 with 18. But
by so doing I substitute for an irreducible solution of five balls a new system
of eight (those shown with the line drawn through them in the diagram),
which can easily be reduced to the desired conclusion, and the game will
be achieved.</p>

<p>There are in reality three terminations possible to the problem—the
single ball, the <em>couple</em>, and the <em>tierce</em>; that is, you may have only one
left, or two placed diagonally, such as 9-17, 25-29, or a system of three in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">[Pg 737]</a></span>
a straight line, 9-16-23. By the “equivalents” you can always succeed
in solving the problem desired.</p>

<p>We will now point out four transformations which are very easy to
effect, and result from the rule of “equivalents.”</p>

<p>1. Replacement of the two balls, situated on the same line and
separated by an empty cup, by one put into that cup. Thus I can replace
23 and 25 by a single ball at 24.</p>

<p>2. Suppression of tierces. And by the above movement I suppress
the tierce 9-16-23.</p>

<p>3. Correspondent “cases” are two holes situated in the same line
and separated by two cups. If two corresponding cups are filled, I can
suppress the balls which occupy them. So I can put aside 4 and 23.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_737.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 868.—Correspondents and equivalents.</div>
</div>

<p>4. It is permissible to move a ball into one of the correspondent cups if
it be vacant; thus I can put 10 into 29.</p>

<p>These are the four transformations which can be made evident with
the rings, without displacing the balls. To do this we need have only seven
rings large enough to pass over the balls and to surround the holes in which
they rest. Let us take an example.</p>

<p><em>Solitaire</em> with 33 holes (fig. 869). <em>Final solution of the single ball.</em></p>

<p>1st Vertical row: 7 and 21 are occupied, and the intermediate hole
14, being empty, I place a ring upon 14.</p>

<p>2nd Vertical row: No. 8 takes 15, and comes into 22; I place a ring
on 22.</p>

<p>3rd Vertical row: I suppress the corresponding balls, 4-23 and 16-31,
there now only remains 9, so I place a ring on 9.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[Pg 738]</a></span></p>

<p>4th Vertical row: I suppress the correspondents 10-29, put 2 into 17,
and I place a ring upon 17.</p>

<p>5th Vertical row: I suppress correspondents 6-25, put 33 into 18, and
I place a ring upon 18.</p>

<p>6th Vertical row: No. 12 takes 19 and comes to 26; I place a ring
on 26.</p>

<p>7th Vertical row: No. 20 is the only ball; I place a ring on 20.</p>

<p>(It must be understood that these operations should be proceeded with
mentally; the balls must not be disturbed.)</p>

<p>We have thus reduced the problem to seven ringed balls, which are 14,
22, 9, 17, 18, 26, and 20 which are indicated on the diagram by the line
drawn through each vertically. They are all comprised in the three horizontal
rows, 3, 4, 5.</p>

<p>We can now set to work upon these three rows in the same manner as
before, considering the rings as balls.</p>

<p>3rd row: We find (and leave) a ring upon 9.</p>

<p>4th row: The two corresponding rings, 17-20, neutralize each other,
and we suppress them. We carry 14 to 17, and take 17 with 18, which
comes into 16. We leave a ring on 16.</p>

<p>5th row: Carry the ring 26 to 23, take 23 with 22, which comes thus
to 24, and we leave a ring on 24.</p>

<p>We now have reduced our problem to three rings, 9, 16, and 24, all in
the central square, indicated in the diagram by horizontal bars. It is easy
to see that 9 will take 16 and 24 and come into 25, and 25 will remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">[Pg 739]</a></span>
alone—as was intended to be done—a single ball upon the board, indicated
by the circle around it in the cut.</p>

<p>By playing the “equivalent” method you will always arrive at this
result—a single ball in No. 25. It may now be perceived how we cannot
only arrive at a satisfactory solution, but by means of the rings ascertain
whether we shall succeed in our game without disturbing a single ball.
After some experience we may even learn to dispense with the rings
altogether.</p>

<p class="center">THE MAGIC TOP—THE GYROSCOPE AND SCIENTIFIC GAMES</p>


<p>We will not do our readers the injustice to suppose that they are not
familiar with the ordinary top,—the delight of all school-boys and young
people,—of which, therefore, we forbear giving any description; but we now
desire to give some details of the construction of the wonderful magic top.
It is composed of a large disc, with an axis turning on two pivots connected
with a circle of iron. When in repose, this plaything exhibits nothing of a
remarkable character; it is completely inert, obeying, like all other bodies,
the laws of gravity. But when we come to give the disc a movement of
rapid rotation, this inert instrument seems to assume a vitality of its own
if we attempt to move it; it resists, and seems to thrust back the hand, and
executes movements even in a contrary direction. Besides this, it appears
to be freed, in a certain measure, from the laws of gravity; if we place it
on its pivot, instead of falling, as it would when the disc is motionless, it
preserves the upright or inclined position in which we place it, the upper
extremity of the axis slowly describing a horizontal circle round the fulcrum
of the other extremity.</p>

<p>Few persons are sufficiently familiar with the theory of mechanics to
understand these phenomena, and it often happens that such a top purchased
to amuse a child becomes an object of wonder and interest to his seniors.
We do not pretend here to explain mathematically the reason of the facts
before us, but the mechanical principle on which this top is constructed is
of such great scientific importance, that we will, in a few words, explain it
to our readers. It is sufficient to have a little knowledge of mechanics to
be aware that a body in motion, subjected to the action of a force tending
to give it a directly contrary motion, will follow a movement in a third
direction, which is termed the resultant of the two others; and this resultant
approaches nearer to one of the original directions, in proportion as the
corresponding movement is more rapid in relation to the other. If, for
example, you strike a billiard ball, which is rolling past you, in such a
manner that you drive it regularly along in the same direction, it appears
only to obey a part of the given impulsion, and continues its course in an
oblique direction, the speed with which it commenced rolling combining
with the impulsion to produce a resultant movement. If it is rolling very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">[Pg 741]</a></span>
quickly, and you strike it gently, it will scarcely turn out of its course. If,
on the contrary, it is moving slowly, and receives a violent shock, it will
run off almost exactly in the direction in which it has been struck.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_741.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 871.—The magic top.</div>
</div>

<p>Now that which occurs in this example of a body tending to two
movements at the same time, is also produced when it is a question of
movements of rotation, so that if a force acts upon a body in rotation in
such a manner as to give it a movement of the same kind round another
axis, a third movement will be originated round a third axis, the direction
of which will be nearest to that in which the rotation is most rapid. Let
us apply this very simple principle to our top, and we shall see that magic
has nothing whatever to do with these movements, which at first glance
appears so extraordinary. Having set it in motion, we rest it on its pivot,
its axis in a horizontal position; we then find that we have two movements
before us; first, that which we gave the top ourselves, and secondly, the
movement of rotation which occurs round a second axis equally horizontal
passing through the fulcrum and perpendicular line to the first. A movement
of rotation therefore originates round a third axis placed between the
two first, but whilst the real axis of the top, obeying this resultant movement,
takes up its new position, the law of gravity continuing to act,
displaces and moves it a little further, so that in endeavouring to reach its
centre of gravity, it turns round its fulcrum (fig. 871). From this explana<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">[Pg 742]</a></span>tion,
it will be easily seen that the more rapid the movement given to the
top,—that due to gravity remaining constant,—the nearer will be the axis of
the resultant movement to its real axis, and consequently the slower will be
the movement of rotation of the whole round the pivot. Thus this apparently
incomprehensible phenomenon is easily explained by gravity, vertical force
producing a movement of rotation in a horizontal plane. One can also
explain by analogous reasoning, and calculation of passive resistance, why
the axis of the top gradually inclines in proportion as the speed of the latter
diminishes, and the speed of rotation round the fulcrum increases; why it
falls immediately if an obstacle is opposed to the latter movement, and
finally, why it produces on the hand which holds it, movements which astonish
persons so intensely who behold it for the first time.</p>

<p>The principle we have just described is often enunciated, by saying
that every body in rapid rotation rests in its plane, and can only be driven
out by a considerable force; this, however, is a defective formula. The
principle should be stated in the following manner. A body in rapid rotation
tends to remain in its plane; that is, its axis rests parallel with itself,
and instead of obeying any force tending to divert its direction, it produces
in consequence of the combination of two simultaneous movements, a displacement
of the axis, generally much feebler and of a different kind from
that which this force exercises on the same body in repose. One of the
most charming applications of this theory is due to M. Foucault. The
<em>Gyroscope</em>, which bears his name, is a heavy disc, the axis of which is supported
by a “<em>Cardan</em>” balance, so that, whatever is the position of the contrivance,
it is possible to preserve it in a constant direction. Therefore if the disc is,
by means of special mechanism, put in rapid rotation, we may give it all
kinds of possible displacement without changing the plane in which the
gyroscope moves. Supposing then that its connection with the suspension
is fixed in a relatively immovable manner, but attracted by a movement
towards the ground, the plane of rotation of the disc will not entirely
participate in this movement. It is true, it will be carried into the movement
of general removal, but it will remain constantly parallel with itself,
and only appears displaced in comparison with the surrounding objects,
which obey more completely than itself the movement of the globe’s rotation
round its poles. Thus can we demonstrate the movement of our
planet. In virtue of the same principle, we see every day passing before
our eyes a crowd of phenomena with which we are so familiar that they do
not excite our attention. Thus it is because the hoop tends to remain in
its plane of rotation that it rolls on without falling or deviating, and for the
same reason that tops rotate vertically on their points, or when they are
running down, describe a series of concentric circles; and for the same
reason again, a juggler is able so easily to hold on the point of a stick a
plate which he puts in rapid rotation, etc. It is also owing to this property
of rotating bodies that we have been enabled to make use of cylindrical or
conical projectiles in artillery. The coiled riflings of the cannon causing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">[Pg 743]</a></span>
projectiles to turn round very rapidly, their axis preserves an invariable
direction during their whole course, until they finally strike the object at
which they are aimed. Without this rotation they would pirouette in an
irregular manner in the air, and besides any precision in firing being impossible,
the resistance of the air would diminish their range to an enormous extent.</p>

<p>The Gyroscope, an instrument now familiar to most scientific persons,
is still a problem of which the solution has not yet been found. It may be
called the paradox of mechanics, for although it depends on gravitation, it
appears to be entirely indifferent to it.</p>

<p>An American scientist has applied electricity to the gyroscope, so as to
make its movements as continuous as possible, and to enable us to study it
more at leisure and with better results. The gyroscope is mounted on a
pedestal which tapers to a point, and supports the instrument. The bar of
the gyroscope on which the electro-magnets are fixed rests upon the top of
the pedestal. One of the extremities of the bobbin is fixed to the cavity,
when the bar and support join, the other extremity communicates with the
bar which joins the nuts of the magnets.</p>

<p>An insulator of hardened caoutchouc is so placed that it just touches
the axis of the wheel twice in every revolution of that wheel. Its plane of
rotation is at right angles to the magnets, and carries an armature of soft
iron which turns very close to the magnet without touching it. The armature
is put <i lang="fr">en rapport</i> with the surface of contact of the cylinder, so that
when the armature approaches it is attracted; but immediately afterwards,
as it reaches the opposite side, the current is interrupted, and the impulse
acquired is sufficient to move the wheel to the spot where the armature can
again come under the influence of the magnet.</p>

<p>The magnets, the wheel, and all the parts of the instrument together
can move around in any direction. When two or four Bunsen cells are
put in connection with the gyroscope, the wheel turns with tremendous
rapidity, and by permitting the magnets to work (an operation which
requires some little dexterity), the wheel not only sustains itself, but also
the magnets and the other subjects which are between it and the extremity
of the pedestal—in opposition to the laws of gravitation. The wheel,
besides turning rapidly around its axis; revolves slowly around the point of
the column in the same direction taken by the lower part of the wheel.</p>

<p>When attaching the arms and counter-poise of the machine, so that
the wheel and the magnets may balance themselves exactly on the pointed
pedestal, the machine remains stationary. But if we give any preponderance
to the wheel and magnets the rotation of the apparatus is in a direction
opposite to that which would result from turning the upper part of the wheel.</p>

<p>The gyroscope illustrates the persistence with which a body that
submits to rotation maintains itself in the plane of its rotation, notwithstanding
the force of gravitation. It also shows the result of the combined action
of two forces tending to produce rotation around two separate axes, which
are, however, situated in the same plane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">[Pg 744]</a></span></p>

<p>The rotation of the wheel round its axis is produced in the present case
by the electro-magnet; and the tendency of the wheel to fall, or to turn in
a vertical plane parallel to its axis, results in the rotation of the entire
instrument upon a new axis, which coincides with the pointed pedestal.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The American Money-Box.</span></p>

<p>During a recent visit to London, as I was one day walking in the
Crystal Palace, my attention was attracted by a curious money-box, surmounted
by a pictorial representation of one of the London streets. The
carriages, horses, and pedestrians were represented by figures cut out of
cardboard, arranged in a groove. A large placard bore this inscription:
“<em>Notice to visitors: Throw a penny in the money-box; and the figures will
perform</em>.”</p>

<p>I at once responded to this invitation, and immediately beheld
the little <em>tableaux</em> become moving and life-like; the cabs rolled along, and
the passers-by walked up and down the street. A number of visitors
followed my example, and there is no doubt the money-box was full at the
end of the day. This ingenious contrivance for obtaining money in so easy
a manner, and without having recourse to a “show-man,” appeared to me
worthy of investigation and description.</p>

<p>The <cite>Scientific American</cite> (New York) has recently given an explanation
of this curious contrivance, and we will here quote what has been published
on the subject.</p>

<p>“Among the inventions intended to obtain contributions of money from
the visitors at the Philadelphia Exhibition,” says the American writer, “we
will describe the singular money-boxes placed in the <em>salons</em> of the principal
hotels and the galleries of the exhibition, etc. These contrivances all
consisted of a case or box, with a glass front, through which can be seen
a landscape in miniature, with trees, houses, figures, etc., all cut out of cardboard,
and painted with great nicety. On the box was a label requesting
the visitor to drop a coin into it and await the result of the contribution.
When the penny has fallen in it puts in motion some hidden machinery, and
then we see the people in the miniature landscape all in motion, riding or
walking or hunting, as the case may be.”</p>

<p>Another box is even more successful, for it places in the hands of the
contributor a photograph of some celebrated person. But to obtain the
photograph we must contribute six pennies. The <em>carte</em> will not come out
if we do not put in the proper coins, and the apparatus is perfectly fair and
honest.</p>

<p>The illustration, fig. 872, shows the apparatus, which is very simple.
On the left the ordinary box is seen, on the right there is a longitudinal
section of it.</p>

<p>At the top of the lower portion, where the money is received in, is a
hollow support, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, which sustains the box in which the photographs are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">[Pg 745]</a></span>
placed upon an inclined plane, and resting against the glass. The pieces of
money, in falling, strike the extremity of a vertical balance, which immediately
turns a toothed wheel, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>. This wheel has as many teeth as there
are pieces of money necessary to purchase the photograph or <i lang="fr">carte de visite</i>.
Upon the escapement wheel is a ratchet arrangement, <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>, the shaft being
moved by a cord rolled around it and attached to a spring, <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>. A bolt, <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span>,
moved by a spring, is kept constantly pressed against the “snail,” <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_745.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 872.—American money-box.</div>
</div>

<p>Thus at each revolution, as the parts of the machinery are animated
by the same movement, the bolt is withdrawn sufficiently to permit a <em>carte</em>
to fall, and then the card next following will be ready resting upon the bolt.
The photographs being placed upon an inclined plane, are pushed forward
by a movable frame, <span class="smcap lowercase">G</span>, which has a roller at the base. So as one card falls
out another is immediately replaced close to the glass.</p>

<p>We have remarked that the wheel has six teeth, so that as one piece of
money dropped in moves it one-sixth of its revolution, six pieces will be
necessary to produce the card. Of course wheels can be made with one or
more teeth, and the payment may be varied for valuable objects at the desire
of the possessor.</p>

<p>The invention is not only a plaything. It can be made useful in the
distribution of pamphlets, or newspapers, which can be introduced into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">[Pg 746]</a></span>
box folded uniformly. They can also be used in omnibuses or tram-cars,
and tickets may be given by the machine on payment of the proper sum of
money.</p>

<p>We will close this chapter with an illustration of a spiral bottle, which
can be done in the manner now to be described, so that the bottle will
actually become a glass spring.</p>

<p>Take a mixture of 180 grammes of lampblack, 60 grammes of gum
arabic, 23 grammes of adraganth, and 23 grammes of benzoin. Make these
ingredients into a paste by the addition of water, and fashion a pencil of the
charcoal thus obtained. This pencil, when heated, will cut the glass wherever
it is applied.</p>

<p>The process is commenced by scraping the bottle with a file and
following the instrument with the red-hot pencil. Wherever the hot pencil
is applied, the glass will be cut as shown in the illustration herewith. It
will be necessary to blow upon the heated pencil to maintain the incandescence
as long as possible. The bottle as cut and representations of the
instruments are given in the cut (fig. 873).</p>

<small>SCIENTIFIC OBJECTS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD.</small></h2>


<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_747.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 874.—Reading wheel desk.</div>
</div>

<p>At the beginning of the seventeenth century there was at Lyons a very
remarkable mansion built by a man named Nicholas Grollier de Servière.
This house was filled with all the most remarkable curiosities and inventions
of the period. The owner belonged to an ancient family. His great-uncle,
Jean Grollier, had amassed a magnificent library, the best in France. His
father was also a celebrated adherent of Henry IV., and M. Servière himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">[Pg 748]</a></span>
had inherited much scientific taste and intelligence from his ancestors. His
house was full of curiosities, ingenious machines, and mysterious clocks,
concerning some of which things we shall have something to say in this
chapter.</p>

<p>M. de Servière’s ingenuity was first apparent in the circular reading
desk, or wheel-desk, on which he put all the books he was likely to require
within a certain time. He seated himself by this revolving desk, and then
was enabled to read any book or paper he desired by merely turning the
wheel with his hands and thus bringing it under his vision. In these days it
is equally possible to collect useful articles either of an electric nature or
otherwise. We have already described the electric pen and the writing
machine, with some other things which might be included in our list of
domestic appliances, but the Chromograph has not been yet illustrated.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">Fig. 875.—The chromograph.</div>
</div>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Chromograph.</span></p>

<p>When we have written with a certain well-known violet “ink” upon a sheet
of paper and applied it to a soft gelatinous surface and rubbed it a few times,
we shall obtain an impression of the writing on the gelatine. By pressing
blank sheets of paper upon this we may pull off quite a number of copies of
our letter or circular. This practice is now so well known that it is scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">[Pg 749]</a></span>
necessary to detail it. The layer of gelatine is made up as follows, and any
of the recipes will suffice.</p>

<p>1. Gelatine 100 grammes, water 375 grammes, glycerine 375
grammes, kaolin 50 grammes. (Lebaigueé.)</p>

<p>2. Gelatine 100 grammes, dextrine 100 grammes, glycerine 1000
grammes, sulphate of baryta <i>q.s.</i> (W. Wartha.)</p>

<p>3. Gelatine 100 grammes, glycerine 1,200 grammes, bouillie de
sulphate de baryta, strained, 500 cubic centimètres. (W. Wartha.)</p>

<p>4. Gelatine 1 gramme, glycerine à 30° 4 grammes, water 2 grammes.
(Kwaysser and Husak.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">Fig. 876.—The chromograph.</div>
</div>

<p>The “mixture” is shaken until it cools to the point of thickening, and
then poured into a zinc vessel. The kaolin or the sulphate of baryta
makes the composition white. It can be treated again with gelatine and
molasses employed for printing rollers. When the proofs have been taken
from the frame the surface may be rubbed with a damp sponge, and then it
will be ready for use again immediately. The introduction of dextrine
facilitates the cleansing of the surface plate.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Campylometer.</span><a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>This instrument, constructed by Lieutenant Gaumet, is very easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">[Pg 750]</a></span>
carried in the pocket, and by a very simple process gives (1) the length of
any line, straight or curved, traced on a map or plan; (2) the actual length
corresponding to a “graphical” length on maps of the scale of 1/80000 or
1/100000, or on maps which are multiples of these numbers.</p>

<p>The instrument consists of a toothed disc, the circumference of which
is dentated exactly in five centimètres. The faces of this disc each carry a
system of divisions; one is divided into four parts, the other into five. The
circumference of the disc (5 centimètres) corresponds to the 4 kilomètres
of the scale of 1/80000, and to 5 kilomètres of that of 1/100000. The division
1/40 of the disc in the former scale measures 100 mètres, and is in it the same
as 1/50 of the other scale.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_750.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 877.—The campylometer.</div>
</div>

<p>The toothed disc moves upon a micro-metric screw, the markings of
which are 0·0015 of a mètre, and a small “rule” or “reglet” carries equal
graduations, as the screw representing lengths so follow:—</p>



<div class="center">
<table class="smaltab" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

  <td align="left">40 <i>kil.</i></td>
  <td align="center">1/80000;</td>
</tr>
</table></div>


<p>The micro-metric screw is fixed in a frame so made as to form a kind of
indicator or guide at one side.</p>

<p>To make use of the campylometer, bring the zero of the disc opposite
the zero of the rule (reglet), then place the instrument on the map in a
perpendicular position; the point will serve as guide, and move the disc upon
the line, whether direct or sinuous, of which you wish to ascertain the length.</p>

<p>When this has been done, note the last graduation of the “reglet”
beyond which the disc has stopped, add to the value of this graduation the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_751" id="Page_751">[Pg 751]</a></span>
complementary length shown by the division of the disc which is opposite
the “reglet.” To find the length of a material line we must add to the
number of centimètres shown by the upper graduation the complement in
millimètres furnished by the division to the 1/50th.</p>

<p>For example, suppose we read 20 upon the upper scale, 35 the division
to the 1/50 opposite the “reglet”; the length obtained is 20 centimètres <em>plus</em>
35 millimètres, or 0·235 mètres. If we are measuring upon a map on the
1/100000 scale, the upper graduations represent kilomètres, the complementary
divisions on the 1/50 scale hundredths of mètres.</p>

<p>For example, suppose again 20 be the superior graduation, 35 the
division to the 1/50 of the disc as before; the distance measured is 20 kilomètres
<em>plus</em> 3,500 mètres, or 23,500 mètres.</p>

<p>On the map the lower graduation of the “reglet” is used. For
instance, if 12 be the upper graduation of the division to 1/40 of the
distance opposite to the “reglet,” the distance measured will be 12,700 mètres.</p>

<p>The campylometer has been specially constructed for maps on the
1/80000 and 1/100000 scales, and calculations can be made easily for any maps
whose scales are multiples or sub-multiples of these. But the instrument
will serve equally well for all maps or plans of which the numerical scale is
known. We must multiply the length of the line expressed in millimètres
by the denominator of the scale divided by 1,000.</p>

<p>So upon an English map to the 1/63360, a length of 155 millimètres
corresponds to a “natural” length of 63,360 multiplied by 155, or 9820·80
mètres.</p>

<p>Thus we perceive that the employment of the campylometer does not
necessitate the tracing of a graphic scale, but only the knowledge of the
numerical scale. When the former only is known, the campylometer may
be used in the following manner:—</p>

<p>Having traced with the disc the line you wish to measure, carry the
instrument to the zero of the scale and let it run inversely the length of
that scale, until the zero of the disc returns opposite to the zero of the
“reglet.” The point at which the disc is stopped on the scale indicates
the length of the line measured upon the map. If the scale be smaller
than the line measured, repeat the operation as many times as may be
necessary.</p>

<p>If it is desirable to ascertain upon a map of a scale of 1/20000 the distance
represented by 1,200 mètres, we have only to place the toothed disc
so that its position marks four times the required distance—that is, 4,800
mètres on the map of 1/80000 (for 4 times 20 = 80). Then move the disc in
the given direction until the zero returns opposite the zero of the “reglet”;
this limit will mark the extremity of the length required.</p>

<p>Explanations are not easy upon paper, but the instrument is found very
easy in actual use. It is employed by the military staff for calculating distances
of any kind, curves or straight lines. On the march, or even on
horseback, the campylometer can be employed.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mysterious Clocks.</span></p>

<p>The clocks represented in the two following illustrations (figs. 878 and
879), are well worthy of being placed in the house of any amateur of science.
They are made of transparent crystal, and though all mechanism is cleverly
concealed they keep capital time. The former clock (fig. 878) is the invention
of Robert Houdin, and consists of two crystal discs superposed and
enclosed in the same frame. One carries the usual numerals, the other
moves upon its centre with the minute
hand attached, and its rotation induces
by the ordinary method the movement
of the hour hand. The requisite
motion is transmitted to the dial by
gear disposed along the circumference
and hidden within the metallic frame,
and is itself put in motion by clockwork,
enclosed in the pedestal of the
timepiece.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<div class="caption">Fig. 878.—Houdin’s clock.</div>
</div>

<p>M. Cadot, in his clock (fig. 879),
retains the plates, but adopts the
rectangular form, so as to preclude all
idea of rotation, and to puzzle those
who are acquainted with the working
of Houdin’s clock. The minute hand
cannot, in this instance, be fixed to
the second glass plate, it preserves its
independence. This movable plate
has only a very slight angular movement
around its centre, which oscillation
or “play” is permitted in the
interior of the rectangular dial. A
little spring movement, hidden in the
central nut of the “hand,” provides in
progressive rotation the oscillation of
the transparent plate, which cannot be perceived to move.</p>

<p>To produce this “balance” motion the plate is supported upon a bar
in the lower part of the metal frame. After the direct oscillation of which
we have spoken, a little spring puts the machinery back. The direct displacement
is produced by a vertical piston which raises the end of the bar.
This piston rests upon a bent lever communicating with a wheel with thirty
triangular teeth. Finally this wheel turns upon its axis once in an hour by
a clockwork arrangement in the pedestal of the clock. Each tooth takes
two minutes to pass, and the movement is communicated to the minute
hand, which thus goes round the dial in the hour. The hour hand is con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753">[Pg 753]</a></span>trolled
by a delicate arrangement hidden in the base. The illustration and
notes will explain the working.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 879.—M. Cadot’s clock.</div>
</div>

<p>M. Henri Robert has also invented a very interesting clock, and one
calculated to excite much curiosity (fig. 881).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_754" id="Page_754">[Pg 754]</a></span></p>

<p>We can see nothing but a crystal dial, perfectly transparent, upon the
surface of which two “hands” move, as upon an ordinary clock face. There
is no machinery visible, and electricity may be credited with the motive
power, because the dial is suspended by two wires. But they will soon be
perceived not to be connected with the hands, and all search for the
mechanism will be fruitless.</p>

<p>The hands, moreover, turn backwards or forwards, and may be moved
by a treacherous finger, but will always return as by a balanced motion to
their position, not the hour which they <em>were</em> at, but to the time which it
actually <em>is</em>. They will take their proper place notwithstanding all efforts to
the contrary, and will then, if let alone, indicate the time as steadily as
ever.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_754.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 881.—M. Robert’s clock.</div>
</div>

<p>The hands of this very mysterious timepiece carry their own motive
power, and consist of unequally balanced levers, so to speak, in which the
clockwork arrangement is intended to disturb the equilibrium. This property
is employed to indicate the hour and the minute, as we will attempt to
show.</p>

<p>The minute hand is the balance, and it is very exactly poised. In the
round box fitted to the end of this hand a plate of platinum is displaced by
clockwork. The centre of gravity being displaced every instant by the
revolution of the weight which goes round once in an hour, the minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755">[Pg 755]</a></span>
hand is forced to follow, and carries the hour hand with it. By the hidden
arrangements the hands are dependent one upon the other, but remain
independent in movement. If they be moved backwards or forwards they
will return automatically to their respective places, and if turned quickly
round the minute hand will return to the proper minute, and the hour hand
to the hour.</p>

<p>The mechanism is simple and ingenious; the principle, however, is not
absolutely novel, and before M. Robert applied it many attempts had been
made to move indicators by the machinery they themselves contained. But
M. Robert has succeeded in adapting the idea beneficially and usefully,
giving it a practical as well as an elegant shape.</p>

<p>The small instrument herewith illustrated (figs. 882 and 883) is very
serviceable for calculators, and its size adapts it for the waistcoat pocket.
It can be used to calculate by addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. Logarithms can be found, and the powers and roots of numbers—even
trigonometrical calculations may be made by its aid. We need not go
into any details regarding the principle of the little “circle.” Such explanations
are only wearying and unsatisfactory at best. The principle is, simply
stated, the theorem that the logarithm of the product of two numbers is equal
to the sum of their logs. The size of the dial will of course regulate the
length of the calculation. The instrument depicted permits of calculation
to three figures with exactitude. M. Boucher, the inventor, hopes to succeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756">[Pg 756]</a></span>
in perfecting an instrument of small size which will combine all <i lang="la">desiderata</i>,
and calculate to high powers.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Pedometer.</span></p>

<p>We all know how useful it is to be able to calculate distances
approximately when upon an excursion or walking tour, and much trouble
is taken by many tourists to ascertain the number of miles they may have
walked in a certain time. The rapid success which the Pedometer has
gained is a testimony to the need it has adapted itself to fill.</p>

<p>The pedometer is much like an ordinary watch in appearance and size.
We perceive a dial with figures and spaces to show the number of paces
walked. The cut represents the mechanism, which is exceedingly simple.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_756a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 884.—Pedometer.</div>
</div>

<p>In the fig. 884, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> is a counter-poise at
the extremity of a lever, which oscillates
around an axis, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>. A screw, <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span>, serves to
limit the extent of these oscillations, and a
spring which acts upon the counter-poise holds
the latter to the upper end. The apparatus
is completed by a movement which counts
the number of oscillations of the lever.</p>

<p>So much being understood, it will be
presumed that if we give to the instrument
an “up-and-down” movement, the spring
which holds the counter-poise, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, being too
weak to compensate the force of inertion of
the latter, it gives way and presses against
the screw, <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span>. When the opposite movement
takes place the counter-poise is at the end of
its course, and so on. Thus during a walk
each step produces an oscillation which the
counter registers.</p>

<p>In the hands of a careful observer, such a pedometer is capable of
registering exact results, and the number of paces being counted, a very
good idea of the number of yards and miles passed over can be arrived at.</p>

<small>SCIENCE AND DOMESTIC ECONOMY.</small></h2>


<p>All branches of applied science are capable of giving us important hints
and rendering us great service in all the conditions of our daily life, and as
we have at various times throughout this volume mentioned useful domestic
inventions applicable for use by means of water, air, etc., we may describe
some more particularly relating to the inside of the house, and the science
of domestic economy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">Fig. 885.—Double window.</div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes during the winter we may feel it very difficult, if not
impossible, to keep the room warm. This we can do, however, by means
of double windows.</p>

<p>Why is it that the double window as used in Russia keeps out the
cold so well? Is it because the room is defended against frost by two
windows instead of there being only one to resist it?—Not entirely. Such
an explanation is not sufficient. If one be protected against the exterior
cold, it is, thanks to the mass of air which is imprisoned, between the two
windows. Extraordinary as it may appear, the air is a very bad conductor
of heat, and forms the best insulator that one can find. The heat of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">[Pg 758]</a></span>
apartment is then perfectly retained by means of the air between the double
windows.</p>

<p>In the same way the double window is not less useful during the
summer, for it prevents the entrance of the heated air into the house. The
double window may therefore be compared to the bournous of the Arab and
the cloak of the Spaniard, which preserves from heat as well as guards
against cold.</p>

<p>The double windows also perform another service. The glasses form
a hot-house. The sun heats the air which is enclosed, and thus between
the panes ferns and even vines will flourish. The windows are very easy to
make, and in the event of any reader desiring to construct one or more, we
give the dimensions. (<i>See</i> fig. 885.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap lowercase">T</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>, is the exterior frame of the window. The two panes are mounted

<div class="caption">Fig. 886.—Sewing machine worked by a dog.</div>
</div>

<p>Animals have been employed for all time to draw carriages and the
plough, etc. But these animal “motors” are usually employed under defective
conditions, and therefore
without full profit. The
inert mass of the animals
remains quite unutilized, his
force only is employed, and
there are many objections on
the score of humanity, as well
as from a mechanical standpoint,
and great muscular
tension with suffering may be
inflicted upon an animal which
is continually mounting a wheel
or such contrivance for raising
water. There was in the Paris
Exhibition a threshing machine
put in motion by a horse walking
upon a pair of rollers which
constituted an “endless” way,
and we will now briefly describe
a machine which utilizes
animal force and weight. It is the invention of M. Richard of Paris,
who has made many mechanical apparatus for industrial purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759">[Pg 759]</a></span></p>

<p>The principle of the invention (fig. 886) consists in the animal utilizing
all the force resulting from his dead-weight. A small box contains the dog
very easily. In the illustration we see the dog at rest, and in that case he
maintains his centre of gravity and exercises no force upon the wheel.
But when the box is inclined, the mere weight of the animal is sufficient
merely to turn the wheel in the direction of the arrows. The dog, finding
himself sliding away, naturally endeavours to move forward, and the rotation
of the wheel is continued; the best results are obtained when the body
is placed entirely upon the descending line, and this result is owing only to
the weight of the animal.</p>

<p>There is a resting-place, just above and outside the “endless” way
traversed by the dog. A basin with water is also provided for the animal.</p>

</div>

<p>M. Robert was let to this discovery in the following way:—He employs
a large number of sewing-machine
hands, and finding
that the working of the machines
had an injurious effect
upon the health of the workers,
he determined to substitute,
in part, other labour for that
of female hands. He then
thought out his “quadrupedal
motors,” which are worked by
intelligent dogs. There is very
little trouble or expense connected
with the working, so
a great saving is effected, as
the dogs cost little, and are
cheaply fed. The result is
that M. Robert has four heavy
machines occasionally at work,
which are kept in motion by
dogs at a very small expense.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Clock-Lamp.</span></p>

<p>The illustration (fig. 887)
represents an ingenious
arrangement, which, by means of combustion of oil in a lamp, indicates the
hour of the night. The design explains itself. Two vertical tubes are
fixed above the reservoir of oil. The left tube contains oil, and is marked
with the hours; the right tube burns the oil as a lamp.</p>

<p>The apparatus is so constructed by the inventor, M. H. Behn, that a
certain quantity of oil is consumed exactly in one hour between two gradua<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">[Pg 760]</a></span>tions
of the hour-tube. A reflector placed beside the lamp enables one to see
the time by night very plainly.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 888.—An “alarum” lamp.</div>
</div>

<p>The apparatus represented below (fig. 888) is an ordinary “alarum” lamp.
It is surmounted by a petroleum lamp, which carries a burner that remains
lighted all night, and which serves as a night-light. The “alarum” carries
an index, represented by the dotted lines in the illustration, and the hands
are fixed (with the index) to the hour you wish to rise in the morning.
The index is fitted with an arrangement which lets loose a vertical bar
represented on the right of the figure. This bar is held by a spring, and
carries a toothed rack which acts upon and raises the wick. At the proper
time the bar is loosed, and the lamp-wick is raised, diffusing a strong and
sudden light through the apartment. This illumination, in concert with
an alarum-bell, generally succeeds in awaking the heaviest sleeper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761">[Pg 761]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Good Petroleum Lamp.</span></p>

<p>This lamp (fig. 889) burns gazoline without the least odour or danger
of explosion. It will serve equally well for petroleum or naphtha. The
gazoline used ought to be 660 grammes weight to the <em>litre</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_761.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 889.—A good petroleum lamp.</div>
</div>

<p>The central portion of the lamp under consideration has an orifice, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>,
which extends through the upper part, and by which the air is admitted to
the centre of the flame. Two vertical plates divide the air-current into four
portions. The chimney-rest, or gallery, forms with the glass three concentric
envelopes, so arranged in stages that the air, when it reaches the plates,
may be more and more carried under the flame. The orifices, <i>a</i> <i>b</i>, carefully
regulated, give access to the exterior air. Including the central one,
there are four currents of air, of which three strike against the flame. These
are very excellent conditions for obtaining perfect combustion, and, consequently,
there is an entire absence of smell and smoke, while the light is
very powerful.</p>

<p>We may add that any glass will be found suitable to this lamp, and
that, in consequence of the separation of the hot air by the currents mentioned,
all danger of the glasses breaking from over-heating is avoided. In pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">[Pg 762]</a></span>vincial
districts, where lamp-glasses are not plentiful, this characteristic
will be appreciated. The lamp can only be filled when it is extinguished,
and thus the chances of explosion are practically obviated. A burner of
twelve lines will give double the light of a moderator of the same capacity,
and cost only a penny or less per hour. The light is perfectly still and
clear.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A New Tap.</span></p>

<p>This new tap is the invention of M. Guyonnet, a Frenchman. The
illustration (fig. 890) gives a very good idea of its construction, and it
permits the gradual release of the liquid without any of the sudden rush
which ordinary taps, or “bungs,” are apt to do. The plug is covered with
indiarubber, and follows a double curve, which reduces the force of the
liquid, and the indiarubber removes any incrustation from the bung hole
into which it may be fitted, and closes the aperture effectively without
force.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_762.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 890.—A new tap.</div>
</div>

<p>In order to guard against a contingency, which, however, is an unlikely
one, the “envelope” (casing) has been made in two pieces, one of which can
never be displaced; the head only can be moved, and it is easily detached.
The plug adapts itself to the aperture as a button to the buttonhole,
and only costs about three halfpence (15 centimes). Ice has no effect
upon the aperture of the barrel, thanks to the indiarubber covering of the
plug. So, altogether, such a tap will be found useful and very cheap.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Trapeze and Swing.</span></p>

<p>We may here notice the simple trapeze and swing for children, which
can be easily fitted up in any house between two rooms. The advantages
of gymnastics for the young are incontestable, but practically there are
difficulties in the way, particularly for those living in towns, but a skilful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_763" id="Page_763">[Pg 763]</a></span>
American has solved the problem in an ingenious way. He has found
means to suspend the trapeze and a swing between the doorposts of a
room without nails or any unsightly wood supports. The trapeze is simply
suspended as represented in the accompanying illustrations.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 892.—The house trapeze.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The bar, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> (<i>see</i> fig. 892), is of wood, terminating in screws enclosed in
the grooves of the wood, at the extremity of which indiarubber discs are
fixed (<span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">C´</span>). When the bar is placed between the side posts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">[Pg 764]</a></span>
open door and with the indiarubber in contact with the sides, the bar, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, is
vigorously screwed in the direction of the arrow, and this motion is transmitted
to the indiarubber discs which press against the door, and the
apparatus remains fixed. The trapeze cords, or the swing ropes, can be
fastened to the bar with hooks, as shown in the illustration, and the solidity
and safety of the bar may be tested by putting heavy weights upon the
ropes before venturing upon the swing, or trapeze. Even violent exercises
may be indulged in without any fear of falling if the bar be firmly screwed
against the sides of the door.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Simple Toys.</span></p>

<p>The accompanying illustration shows us a circlet of paper, very thin,
fastened upon a frame, with paper wings fixed to the radii. This “screw”
fashioned wings and the circlet can be kept up in the air by means of a
hand screen. The effect will be observable in the rapid revolution of the
little paper wheel, which must be very light and thin. (<i>See</i> fig. 893.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_764.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 893.—The paper wheel.</div>
</div>

<p>There are many toys which can be controlled by the use of indiarubber
springs. The bicyclist in the cut (fig. 894) is an instance in point. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">[Pg 765]</a></span>
turns around a pivot, and the tension of the spring keeps the machine in its
place.</p>

<div class="figright">

<div class="caption">Fig. 894.—The bicycle toy.</div>
</div>

<p>The swimming-fish (fig.
895) is moved by an indiarubber
spring, much as the drawing-room
kite is elevated in the
air. The spring of indiarubber
is twisted to make the fish swim,
and the caoutchouc is adapted
to a toothed wheel which has a
clock-work motion that gives
the tail a motion sideways and
round, acting like a propeller,
and thus the fish swims.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">Fig. 895.—The fish.</div>

<p>It is perhaps as well to
say how these fish are managed,
because then children will not
break them, when they have
been purchased, to see what is
inside. Very young students
are very fond of analyses of
this nature, but synthesis, or putting together, is a far superior occupation
in these circumstances to analysis, and to put together more lawful than to
pull asunder.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tree-felling by Steam.</span></p>

<p>The machine constructed a few years ago by Messrs. Ransome, and
which was tried at Roupell Park, near London, seems to combine all the
<i lang="la">desiderata</i> in the matter of mechanical tree-felling. Many experiments have
been previously made by people to cut down trees by means of steam
machinery, but none of them included all the conditions necessary for
success. The Ransome Machine cut down four large trees in forty minutes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_766.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 896.—Ransome’s tree-felling machine.</div>
</div>

<p>The apparatus, as shown in the illustration, is not unlike, in appearance,
the perforating machines employed in boring rocks, in which the drill is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_767" id="Page_767">[Pg 767]</a></span>
replaced by a saw. The cylinder is small, and works at high pressure; a
piston moves the saw in a guide-frame. The machine is firmly fixed against
the tree, and the support is fastened by a chain.</p>

<p>A rack arrangement provides for the turning of the machine as the saw
continues to cut its way through the trunk of the tree.</p>

<p>The weight is not excessive, and the necessary steam is supplied by a
portable furnace and boiler, which communicates with the saw-motion by
a flexible tube. The saw can cut through a horizontal as well as through a
perpendicular trunk—thus timber can be rapidly cut up.</p>

<p>Another ingenious sawing machine is that invented by Mr. W. W. Giles,
of Chicago, United States, America. This apparatus is about eight feet
long, and one extremity is fixed to the trunk of the tree to be operated on.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_767.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 897.—Sawing machine.</div>
</div>

<p>The operator sits upon a ledge or saddle at the opposite end, and
putting his feet upon the treadles, pushes them and the saw forward;
this movement is assisted by the weight of the hands on the lever. The
saw, under these circumstances, cuts into the wood with great force, and
when the operator pushes <em>the lever</em> forward he brings the force of his legs to
bear at the same time, and carries the saw back again. So feet, hands,
dead weight with the saw itself, combine at once upon the tree, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">[Pg 768]</a></span>
blade quickly does its work. The saw is three feet long and is very easily
manipulated.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Way of Preserving Grapes.</span></p>

<p>Remarkable progress has been made of late years in the conservation
of various articles of food, and we may here speak of the preservation of the
grape.</p>

<p>We will first mention M. R. Charmoux’s method, which is called the
“Fresh Grape” system. The portion of the building used for the business
is on the first floor, as nearly as possible in the centre of the building, so as
to be guarded from damp. Two windows are sufficient for all purposes,
one to the north, and one to the south. They may be merely kept shut
on ordinary occasions, but when frost comes they must be draped and
“packed” with nets filled with moss or dried seaweed. The principal one
of the windows is to admit of the cleansing of the room and for the admission
of air in the summer time, when there are not many grapes left.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 898.—Grape preserving.</div>
</div>

<p>In winter the apartment may be warmed by hot air, and if this cannot
be managed the ordinary means must be resorted to to keep up the temperature.
The upper clusters of grapes should first be picked, for shade
conduces to longevity of the fruit, and the 20th October is about the time
to commence. A fine day should be chosen; a cloudy day will suit provided
there is no dew or dampness in the air.</p>

<p>The finest bunches are cut first, and care must be taken to separate
them at the end of the stalk, having three “eyes” under the grape and two
above it. The leaves should be at once cut off, and the grapes put with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">[Pg 769]</a></span>
great caution into boxes or baskets to be taken to the preserving house,
where each stalk is plunged into a phial holding about 125 grammes of
water, into which, two or three days previously, a teaspoonful of wood
charcoal has been put.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_769a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 899.—Hanging the grapes.</div>
</div>

<p>The phials are suspended as shown in the accompanying illustration
(fig. 899), and then certain precautions must
be observed: they must not be disturbed, nor
must any draught be admitted, as the temperature
must not descend below 1° to 2° cent.
There is no necessity to change the water in
the bottles; very little will evaporate between
November and May, when the process ought
to be finished, but the phials must neither be
corked nor concealed.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_769b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 900.—Drying process</div>
</div>

<p>In the <em>dry</em> process the same house can
be used, and stagings are employed. These
frames are furnished with grooved boxes inclined
towards each other, and lined with very
dry fern-leaves or straw (fig. 900). Some
days after the phials have been filled cut the grapes successively at the first
time, which generally begins about
the 6th to the 12th of November.
The grapes are then put in baskets
and carefully carried to the preserving
room, where they are
ranged in the boxes so as not to
touch. Each box contains about
six kilogrammes of grapes.</p>

<p>All the time of the conservation
process care must be taken
to eradicate all grapes which
change colour or alter in any
way. If dampness be feared have
a lighted stove in the room for a
time. Grapes are also preserved
<i lang="fr">en espalier</i>, but not so well. Sometimes
a mouldy smell will be perceived
in the room; to prevent
this ventilators should be placed in the ceiling, which must, however, never
be opened until the mouldy smell renders such a proceeding absolutely
necessary.</p>

<small>SOME CURIOUS MODES OF TRANSIT.</small></h2>


<p>We have already noticed some novel means of locomotion in the water
and in the air, and now a few of the
means whereby locomotion is attained as
a recreation or as an exhibition may be
mentioned.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_770a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 901.—New car.</div>
</div>

<p>For instance, here is a very curious
vehicle, and the explanation of it we give in
the words of the anonymous inventor:—</p>

<p>“My vehicle will carry four people without
counting the driver. It is strong, easy
to draw, and can turn in a horse’s length.
The driver completely controls the animal,
and no dust is thrown up to inconvenience
the sitters, for by the time it rises the car
is well in advance of it. It is
cheap; the harness is simple and
safe. The horse is sheltered
from heat and rain
and flies. If he should
fall, there is no more
than ordinary danger to
life and limb than if he
fell in a carriage; and,
last of all, no very showy
animal is needed, so long
as his wind is sound,
and his legs and tail respectable.
Travellers in
this “trap” can sit in
any position, back to back, or face to face, two and two. The weight is
all near the collar, and the animal is under control most perfectly.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_770b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 902.—Side view of vehicle.</div>
</div>

<p>“The estimated cost is £40; the horse about £40, or less; harness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_771" id="Page_771">[Pg 771]</a></span>
(say), £7, which contrasts favourably with the expenses of an ordinary one
horse vehicle.”</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Endless Rails.</span></p>

<p>These adjuncts to locomotion can be adapted to any kind of vehicle, and
are in pieces about two feet long, articulated, and resting upon a base to give
the necessary stability. The endless rail entirely envelopes the wheels all
along the train, and the right and left rails are quite independent of each
other, and as the vehicles advance the rails are put down and raised again
when the carriages have passed. In front there are two distributing wheels
governed by the tractive power, so that as the engine, or the animal drawing
the train turns aside, the rails are still laid down parallel as before, but the
hind wheels will not permit of very sharp curves.</p>

<p>There are wheels also at the rear of the train, and as on curves one
wheel will pass over more rail than another, and in the hinder wheels a
differential arrangement is used, and when one goes back the other advances
as much, and so the relative distance is kept up, for the rail does not alter
in length at all. The wheels have double flanges to retain them on the line.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_771.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 903.—Endless rails.</div>
</div>

<p>The system, considered from a mechanical point of view, gives striking
results, and very little effort is required to put the train in motion. The
resistance is very small, and much greater weights can, of course, be transported
upon the endless rail than upon the ordinary road.</p>

<p>The experiment has been tried in the Tuilleries Gardens in Paris.
Three carriages filled with children are drawn by two goats without any
fatigue, and in the ordinary goat carriages at least twelve of the animals
would be necessary—that is, four to each carriage. The economy of this
mode of transport is therefore incontestable. The usual rate is about three-and-a-half
to four miles an hour, so it is not adapted for travellers, but for
merchandise.</p>

<p>The system might be applied to numerous vehicles on all kinds of roads
for horses and oxen, in mines and factories, and in colonial plantations.
M. Ader, the inventor, intended the system to be applied in the Landes,
where the rails would lie close upon the sandy soil, and the expense of
“metalling” roads would be entirely done away with. The adoption of the
endless rail method of conveyance would prove a fortune to the Landes, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_772" id="Page_772">[Pg 772]</a></span>
pine forests abound, and the wood and resin which is lost for want of transport
could be removed and sold to advantage.</p>

<p>The endless rail may also be used upon the ordinary road in places
where the highways are out of repair.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">Fig. 904.—The <i>Nina</i>.</div>
</div>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Smallest Steamboat in the World.</span></p>

<p>The picture (fig. 904) shows us the <em>Nina</em>, the tiniest steamer afloat.
The keel is somewhat over twelve feet in length, and about three feet wide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_773" id="Page_773">[Pg 773]</a></span>
the depth of water ten inches. A speed of about five-and-a-half miles an
hour can be obtained with a pressure of one hundred pounds. It is a twin-screw
“ship” with propellers of three blades. The <em>Nina</em> was built on the
lines of the <em>Nautilus</em>, of cedar and oak, and coppered. It is stated to be
a marvel of solidity and lightness. The chimney is movable, and can be
lowered at pleasure if a bridge be too low. There is ample room for provisions
for the occupant in a frame which can be attached to the sides or
fixed astern. The boat is easily carried in sections, and can be transported
easily from place to place.</p>

<p>The weights of the various portions are as follows:—The hull 90 lb.,
boiler 80 lb., engine 25 lb., machinery 20 lb.; total, 215 lb. Forty pounds
of good charcoal can be packed into the sides of the boat in racks.
The rudder can be so connected by wires that the feet will perform the
function of steering, thus leaving the hands free to attend to the engine, so
the occupant is perfectly at liberty to go where and how he pleases.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_773.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 905.—An old chaise.</div>
</div>

<p>For river navigation or calm sea-steaming the <em>Nina</em> is admirably
adapted, and any one who can be stoker, steersman, and engineer, as well as
passenger and crew, will enjoy a trip in such a boat. Such a steamer costs
about £250, but it might be less. It may be added that the <em>Nina</em> has
uniformly behaved well, and was built by Fordham of New York.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Mechanical Carriage.</span></p>

<p>A distinguished <em>savant</em> of the seventeenth century, Ozanam by name,
a member of the Academy of Science, gave in 1693 a curious description
of a mechanical carriage, which may perhaps be regarded as the parent of
the velocipede and the bicycle. We here reproduce the engravings from
Ozanam’s work and his words.</p>

<p>“Some years ago,” wrote the philosopher in 1693, “there may have
been seen in Paris a chaise,” as in the picture, “and which a servant, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774">[Pg 774]</a></span>
pressing alternately upon treadles” (as in the detail), “caused to progress
by turning two small wheels hidden in a frame between the hinder pair
of wheels of the chaise. The description I give as I received it from
M. Richard, the doctor of Rochelle.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> is a roller attached to the box behind the vehicle, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> is a pulley,
over which the cord that works with the treadles passes; <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span> are the
treadles, with pedals, <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span>. The wheels, <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>, being thus put in motion, the
large wheels are moved, and when the hind wheels move forward, the
foremost ones must advance also, and the sitter has only to guide the
machine by the reins he holds attached to the guiding axle.”</p>

It is well known that ants, by touching the skin of aphides, extract therefrom
a secretion of viscous matter, which nourishes them. They will frequently carry off the
aphides to their habitations, and keep them there; thus one may say they <i>keep a cow in their
stable</i>.</div>

The preservation of insects, and their preparation for collections, necessitates some
precaution. Entomologists are in the habit of spreading them out on a small board, and
arranging the legs and <i>antennæ</i> by means of large pins. The wings should be dried by
placing them on strips of paper, which preserves them. These precautions are indispensable
if it is wished that the insects in a collection should retain their distinctive characters.
Worms and caterpillars can be raised in pots filled with earth, if carefully covered over with
muslin or wire gauze with very fine meshes. The process of hatching may give rise to many
interesting observations.</div>

See “<i>La Nature</i>,” 4th year, 1876, 2nd half-year, p. 167. M. A. Guillemin mentions,
in connection with the phenomenon of July 12th, 1876, the presence of light masses of cloud
of a greyish-blue colour, similar to those perceived in the phenomena just described.</div>

M. A. G. has written us an interesting letter on the subject of similar experiments,
which we here transcribe:—

<p>
“When a siphon of seltzer water has been opened some little time, and the equilibrium
of tension is nearly established between the escaped gas and the dissolved gas, a vertical
stream of bubbles is seen to rise from the bottom of the apparatus, which present a very clear
example of the law of ascension of bubbles; that is to say (putting out of the question the
expansion of the bubbles in their passage upwards), it is an inverse representation of the law
of gravity affecting falling bodies. The bubbles, in fact, detach themselves from their starting
point with perfect regularity; and as the interval varies in one file from another, we have
before us a multiplied representation of that terrible law which Attwood’s machine made such
a bugbear to the commercial world. I believe it is possible, by counting the number of
bubbles that detach themselves in a second, in each file, and the number which the whole
stream contains at a given instant, to carry the verification further; but I must confess that
I have not done so myself.”</p></div>

The experiment we have just described is a very old one. M. V. Sircoulon has told us
that it was described at length in the works of Rabelais. The following remarks are in
“Pantagruel,” book II., chap. xvii.

<p>
“Panuræ then took two glasses of the same size, filled them with water, and put one on
one stool, and the other on another, about five feet apart, and placed the staff of a javelin
about five-and-a-half feet long across, so that the ends of the staff just touched the brim of the
glasses. That done, he took a stout piece of wood, and said to the others: “Gentlemen,
this is how we shall conquer our enemies; for in the same way that I shall break this staff
between these two glasses, without the glasses being broken or injured, or spilling a single
drop of water, so shall we break the head of our Dipsodes, without any injury to ourselves,
and without getting wounded. But that you may not think there is magic in it, you, Eusthenes,
strike with this stick as hard as you can in the centre.” This Eusthenes did, and the staff
broke in two pieces, without a drop of water being spilt.</p></div>

It is the same with a number of other common products, such as clay, sandstone, etc.,
the composition of which chemistry has revealed. Argil, or clay, slate, and schist all contain
a metal—<i>aluminium</i>, which has become most valuable for industrial purposes. Stones for
building are composed of a metal combined with carbon and oxygen—<i>calcium</i>; sandstone
is composed of <i>silicium</i>, a metallic body united with oxygen; and sulphate of magnesia,
which enters into the composition of a purgative drink, also contains a metal—<i>magnesium</i>.</div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
